Incentive :D

---

 <img src="pictures/question.svg" />

Note: But how do we track all these contributions that we make

---

 <img src="pictures/github.svg" />

Note: GitHub gives us some of this functionality

Pretty graphs and the like

---

 <img src="pictures/github-a.svg" />

Note: but it's not exactly perfect

And it only include itself

---

 <img src="pictures/OtherSources.svg" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: For OpenStack, there's context specific tools

There are tools that have come out of the GitHub data hack days.

---

 <img src="pictures/question.svg" />

Note: But what about everything else?

Code Review

Documentation 

Testing 

Design 

UAT 

Promotion 

User Groups

Presentations

Note: These are all contributions

Not even including all the aspects of the SDLC that go unattributed

Community, yo

---

 <img src="pictures/help.svg" />

Note: So, how can we track and record and acknowledge all this?

---

 <img src="pictures/leslie.png" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: Let me tell you about Leslie

Amazing human being


---

# #LABHR <!-- .slide: class="center" -->
## bit.do/LABHR

Note: She started this hashtag, and wrote a blog post about it

---

 <img src="pictures/ikea_manual.jpg" style="margin-top: -50px" />

 <img src="pictures/meeting.svg" />

Note: Leslie and Deb meet over coffee

"It gives me a place to hang my hat"

---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_0.svg" />

Note: So Leslie + Blog = 5 steps

---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_1.svg" />

Note: write the list

---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_2.svg" />

Note: send the list

---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_3.svg" />

Note: GRAVY

Tweet about it

---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_4.svg" />

Note: GRAVY #2

Linked in Recommendations

NOT endorsements

See later

 <img src="pictures/Solution_L.svg" />


Note: GRAVY #3

Do it for someone not like you

---

 <img src="pictures/yay.svg" />

Note: Simple! Nice! Helpful!

---

 <img src="pictures/halp.svg" />

Note: But it didn't get that much traction

Leslie reported ~30 known LinkedIn recommendation

I've done talks for: Python, PHP, iOS, Ops

I've done talks in: Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Wellington; all the major locations

It's always the same, one or two after the talk

(PyConAU exception - because I refused to get off stage until 10 tweets happened)

(This did result in some residiual activity during the sprints

Maybe y'all need a LIVE DEMO

Note: Chris was a little bit upset last time this happened

---

 <img src="pictures/tweet_2.png" />

Note: And not just him.

---

 <img src="pictures/tweet_3.png" />

Note: It took a third party to actually confirm they did good.

I've seen this before, not only in the #LABHR

# Minimisation <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

# Tall Poppy Syndrome <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: We are reluctant to allow ourselves to be elevated in front of our peers, lest we be cut down.

# Acknowledging our own achievements <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: one way to break this is to start to acknowledge our own achievements

Note: Lara Hogan, Donut Manifesto

This donut = draft of a book

Giving ourselves a little celebration if noone else will

Tweeting the donut

Piggybacking on a picture of a donut (instagram makes this OK).


---

# Not all contributions are donuts <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: sometimes it's the little things that add up onto something big

---

# Stack Overflow <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: How many people go onto stackoverflow to ask

How many to answer

---

 <img src="pictures/so1.png" />

Note: SO recently 10 million questions.

Go on there and find your project's tag, and thank the people who are answering your things for you

You might have a standalone SO instance for your Q&A

---


 <img src="pictures/so2.png" />


Note: 

If a dev found a solution just half of those times, and it saved them just 30 minutes, that's nearly 1.85 billion hours saved.

It's enough to read all of Wikipedia. 12,000 times.

8 million developers come here every day.

It'd be a bigger country than more than half the world's nations.

There are about 51,000 developers on the site at any given second. This is what 51,000 people looks like.

Together, we've built a place where every 12 seconds a developer posts an answer that helps fellow coders.

Note: Your community advocates need your thanks

You can thank them by giving them something extremely useful

Note: Apart from it being a nice thing todo.

Note: Looking at any github project page we can see all the contributors right?

THere's a button right at the top and everything

Note: But if we click it, then we don't actually get the contributors

We get the top ones, with a graph, ranked by lines of code
