Note: But how do we track all these contributions that we make

---

@ github.svg

Note: GitHub gives us some of this functionality

Pretty graphs and the like

---

@ github-a.svg

Note: but it's not exactly perfect

And it only include itself

---

@^ OtherSources.svg

Note: For OpenStack, there's context specific tools

There are tools that have come out of the GitHub data hack days. 

---

@ question.svg

Note: But what about everything else?

Code Review

Documentation

Testing

Design

UAT

@^ halp.svg

Note: But it didn't get that much traction

Leslie reported ~30 known LinkedIn recommendation

I've done talks for: Python, PHP, iOS, Ops

I've done talks in: Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Wellington; all the major locations

It's always the same, one or two after the talk

(PyConAU exception - because I refused to get off stage until 10 tweets happened)

(This did result in some residiual activity during the sprints

Maybe y'all need a LIVE DEMO

---

#= How to<br>be nice
##= [demo]

Note: Live demo, lets hope this works

Hat Rack Someone

---

#= How to<br>say thank you
##= [demo]

Note: 

Ensure repeated for mic

THIS DIDNT HAPPEN LAST TIME

@ tweet_1.png

Note: Chris was a little bit upset last time this happened

--- 

@ tweet_2.png

Note: And not just him.

--- 

@ tweet_3.png

Note: It took a third party to actually confirm they did good.

I've seen this before, not only in the #LABHR

---

#= Why can't we take a compliment?

---

#= Minimisation

Note: Antonym of exagguration

"She'll be right, no worries"

---

#= Tall Poppy Syndrome

Note: We are reluctant to allow ourselves to be elevated in front of our peers, lest we be cut down.


---

#= Acknowledging our own achievements

Note: one way to break this is to start to acknowledge our own achievements

---

@ donut.jpg

Note: Lara Hogan, Donut Manifesto

This donut = draft of a book

Giving ourselves a little celebration if noone else will

Tweeting the donut

Piggybacking on a picture of a donut (instagram makes this OK). 


---

#= Not all contributions are donuts

Note: sometimes it's the little things that add up onto something big

---

#= Stack Overflow

Note: How many people go onto stackoverflow to ask

How many to answer

---

@ so1.png

Note: SO recently 10 million questions. 

Go on there and find your project's tag, and thank the people who are answering your things for you

You might have a standalone SO instance for your Q&A

---


@ so2.png


Note:

If a dev found a solution just half of those times, and it saved them just 30 minutes, that's nearly 1.85 billion hours saved.

It's enough to read all of Wikipedia. 12,000 times.

8 million developers come here every day.

It'd be a bigger country than more than half the world's nations.

There are about 51,000 developers on the site at any given second. This is what 51,000 people looks like.

Together, we've built a place where every 12 seconds a developer posts an answer that helps fellow coders.

Note: Not getting acknowedgement suck

Burnout

Plight of the organiser

Note: They have done a thing once, they will do it again.

Edge case

---
#= Recommendations

@^ linked_in_sections.svg

Note: Here's all the different sections that you can fill on your profile

---

@^ linked_in_sections_recommendable.svg

Note: But here are the only ones that are able to be recommendable

---

@^ Linked_in_EE.svg

---

@^ Linked_in_EE_only.svg

Note: Running a conf, volenteering as a thing, is **experience** 

LIST IT AS SUCH

#= Endorsements
##- possibly not as helpful

---

#= What counts?
##- Issues and Pull Requests
###- in the past year
##- Commits
###- <p>(against <code>master</code> or <code>gh-pages</code>)</p>


---

#= But only if...

##- you own the repo
##- or, you're a collaborator
##- or, you're in the owner organisation
##- or, you forked the repo
###- ... but commits don't count on forks

---

#= What counts?
##- Only some of your work. 

---

#= Sound too hard?
##- It's ok, there's a hack for that

@ revealjs.png

Note: Looking at any github project page we can see all the contributors right?

THere's a button right at the top and everything

---

@ revealjs2.png

Note: But if we click it, then we don't actually get the contributors

We get the top ones, with a graph, ranked by lines of code
