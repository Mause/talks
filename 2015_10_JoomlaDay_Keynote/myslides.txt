#= Build a Better<br>Hat Rack
## All Contributions Welcome

@ footer.svg

Note: These are my speaker notes. 

There are many like them, but these ones are mine

---

#= Hi!

Note: Hi! I'm Katie, and I'm a software developer. 

I wear many hats. I use all the languages.

@ openstack_docker.png

Note: I do OSS contributions

Docker have paid me for my contributions

I am also an Active Technical Contributor for Open Stack

Want to know what my contribution to OpenStack was?

@ OpenStackDiff.png

Note: an inline documentation change. It's a Python file, yo

---

@^ SummitToyko.png

Note: 

If you committed within the window, you got a free ticket to Tokyo

Incentive Driven Code Development

---

@ question.svg

Note: But how do we track all these contributions that we make

---

@ github.svg

Note: GitHub gives us some of this functionality

Pretty graphs and the like

---

@ github-a.svg

Note: but it's not exactly perfect

And it only include itself

There are other ways - project specific, etc

---

@ question.svg

Note: But what about everything else?

Code Review

Documentation

Testing

Design

UAT

Promotion

User Groups / Presentations

---

@^ straw_poll.png

Note: Who here:

Has committed code to Joomla? - Dont answer the next ones

Who here has not used Joomla

Who has introduced Joomla to others?

Who is only here because you're interested in learnign more?


---

<img src="pictures/youre-awesome.gif" style="width: 250%; margin-top: -50px">

Note: These are all contributions

Not even including all the aspects of the SDLC that go unattributed

Community, yo

---

@^ help.svg

Note: So, how can we track and record and acknowledge all this?

--- 

@^ leslie.png

Note: Let me tell you about Leslie

Amazing human being


---

#= #LABHR
## bit.do/LABHR

Note: She started this hashtag, and wrote a blog post about it

---

@^ ikea_manual.jpg

Note: Which I've turned into a easy to read manual to try and spread the message

---

# DÅLIGORDLEK
@ hatrack.svg


Note: It's a bad pun

---

@^ meeting.svg

Note: Leslie and Deb meet over coffee

Leslie of Google / Elastic

Deb of Open Innovation Network

Sahana Software Foundation


Software for developing countries



“No, this is great. This gives me one of those places to hang your hat. 

You know, something you can list on your LinkedIn profile instead of just a project that you work on for free because you love it.

But no one really knows about it or notices.”



---

@ Solution_0.svg

Note: So Leslie + Blog = 5 steps

---

@ Solution_1.svg

Note: write the list

---

@ Solution_2.svg

Note: send the list

---

@ Solution_3.svg

Note: GRAVY

Tweet about it

---

@ Solution_4.svg

Note: GRAVY #2

Linked in Recommendations

NOT endorsements

See later


---

@ Solution_L.svg


Note: GRAVY #3

Do it for someone not like you

---
 
@ yay.svg

Note: Simple! Nice! Helpful!

---

@^ halp.svg

Note: But it didn't get that much traction

Leslie reported ~30 known LinkedIn recommendation

I've done talks for: Python, PHP, Ops

I've done talks in multiple different cities

It's always the same, one or two after the talk

(PyConAU exception - because I refused to get off stage until 10 tweets happened)
(This did result in some residiual activity during the sprints)


Maybe y'all need a LIVE DEMO

---

#= How to<br>be nice
##= [demo]

Note: Live demo, lets hope this works

#= Hi, Jack!


---

@ tweet_davey.png

Note: Jack is a force of good for the community - Davey

---

#= How to<br>say thank you
##= [demo]

Note: 
Repeat for mic, if required. 



---
#= How not to<br>react

Note: 

This didn't happen last time. Ref Chris. 

---

@ tweet_chris.png

Note: Chris was a little bit upset last time this happened

Ref Tom

---

@ tweet_tom.png

Note: And not just him.

--- 

@ tweet_russ.png

Note: It took a third party to actually confirm they did good.

Ref Russell. 

I've seen this before, not only in the #LABHR

---

#= Why can't we take a compliment?

---

##= Minimisation

Note: Antonym of exaggeration

"She'll be right, no worries"

Understating

---

##= Tall Poppy<br>Syndrome

Note: We are reluctant to allow ourselves to be elevated in front of our peers, lest we be cut down.

And of course, everyone's favourite

---

##= Imposter<br>Syndrome


Note: If we get thanked, we tend not to think it actually applies, because all the problems

---

#= Acknowledging just how splendid we are

Note: We are amazing. We are splendid. We need to ack that. 

Note: The fact that I didn't know half of these existed is a problem in itself.

Note: Python Software Foundation awards

Community Service

@ oreilly_awards.png

#= Acknowledging our *own* achievements

Note: one way to break this is to start to acknowledge our own achievements

---

@ donut.jpg

Note: Lara Hogan, Donut Manifesto

This donut = draft of a book

Giving ourselves a little celebration if noone else will

Tweeting the donut

Piggybacking on a picture of a donut (instagram makes this OK). 


---

@^ MyDonut.jpg

Note: I like the idea of donuts. This is one I did the other day.

I'm not trying to be self-gratifying, but sometimes, you need to do that.

---

#= Not all contributions are donuts

Note: sometimes it's the little things that add up onto something big

---

#= Stack Overflow


---

@ MyStackOverflowProfile.png

Note: The profiles are now really nice!

---

#= Just a drop<br>in the ocean

Note: 
How many people go onto stackoverflow to ask

Does anyone know how many questions there have been answered on SO?


---

@ so1.png

Note: SO recently 10 million questions. 

Go on there and find your project's tag, and thank the people who are answering your things for you

You might have a standalone SO instance for your Q&A

---


@ so2.png


Note:

If a dev found a solution just half of those times, and it saved them just 30 minutes, that's nearly 1.85 billion hours saved.

It's enough to read all of Wikipedia. 12,000 times.

8 million developers come here every day.

It'd be a bigger country than more than half the world's nations.

There are about 51,000 developers on the site at any given second. This is what 51,000 people looks like.

Together, we've built a place where every 12 seconds a developer posts an answer that helps fellow coders.

---

#=
@ so3.png

Note: Your community advocates need your thanks

You can thank them by giving them something extremely useful

---

#= But why say<br>thank you?

Note: Apart from it being a nice thing todo. 

---


#= It's nice thing to do

Note: Not getting acknowedgement sucks

Burnout

Plight of the organiser
---

#= Encourage continued engagement

Note: They have done a thing once, they will do it again.

---

#= Voluntold

Note: I'm super encourageable. I think half the stuff i do is average until validated

---

#= "Foot in the Door"

Note: "Fear, Uncertainty<br>and Dopamine" - Paul Fenwick 
 
Amazing talk about a few different issues about hacking brains 

Brilliant riff about making contrubutors stick

Foot in the Door - Drive Safely sign - 17% baseline, 76% with pre-sticker

Car Bumper Stickers

A tiny little foot in the door

STICKERS

Little things = seed, -> improvement over time

"If you see someone doing something like that - acknowledge them like crazy


---

#= Change self image

Note:
it makes them feel valued

self image change, they feel included in the project, and it makes them feel good

but it also binds their fate to yours

if your project fails, it reflects badly on them, because they are now involed in your project


---

@ question.svg

Note: But just how can we say thank you

---

#= Communication<br>within<br>your project

Note: Mentioning things in your release notes is a good thing. MediaGolbin does this

Drupal concatenates thread commentors into git commit message

But the scope of this communication is only within your existing community. 

You need to extend to more general communications 
---
#= Communication<br>outside<br>your project

---
#= Give your helpers something to show for their work

---
@^ b_linked.png

Note: This is the new age resume. Publically accessible. We can thank people who would otherwise be unrecognised

LinkedIn is pretty awful though. 

---

#= Recommendations<br>vs<br>Endorsements

Note: Two main ways to add content to someone's linkedin profile

---
#= Recommendations

---

@^ linked_in_sections.svg

Note: Here's all the different sections that you can fill on your profile

---

@^ linked_in_sections_recommendable.svg

Note: But here are the only ones that are able to be recommendable

---

@^ Linked_in_EE.svg

---

@^ Linked_in_EE_only.svg

Note: Running a conf, volenteering as a thing, is **experience** 

LIST IT AS SUCH

---

#= Endorsements
##- ... possibly not as helpful

---

@^ SkillsNew.png

---

@^ b_github.png

---
#= User<br>Contributions

@ gh_start.png

Note: No idea how the 'Repositories contributed to' works

I've done Rails, Rubocop, Docker, OpenStack, Pybee... they arent there

---
<br><br>
@ public_contrib.png

Note: focus on this graph. So much focus
---

#= What counts?
##- Commits
###- <p>(against <code>master</code> or <code>gh-pages</code>)</p>
##- Issues and Pull Requests
###- (opened, in the past year)

Note: Continued discussions on a PR only counts as one

---

#= But only if...

##- you own the repo
##- or, you're a collaborator
##- or, you're in the owner organisation
##- or, you forked the repo
###- ... but commits don't count on forks

---

#= What counts?
##- Only some of your work. 


Note: But what if you really want that full green graph
---

#= Sound too hard?
##- It's ok, there's a hack for that

---
##  <pre><code style="font: 'monospace' 150%">$ pip install rockstar</code></pre>
##- <pre><code style="font: 'monospace' 150%">$ rockstar</code></pre>

#= Project<br>Contributions

---

@ revealjs.png

Note: Looking at any github project page we can see all the contributors right?

THere's a button right at the top and everything

---

@ revealjs2.png

Note: But if we click it, then we don't actually get the contributors

We get the top ones, with a graph, ranked by lines of code

---
@^ revealjs2a.png
<p style="margin-top: -50px">...</p>
@ revealjs3.png

Note: And it's only the top 100

---

#= This is only some of the contributions

---

#= What about<br>everything else?
##- Logged Issues
##- Unmerged Pull Requests
##- Code Reviews
##- Feature Discussions
##- Feature Voting

---

#= What if... 


Note: What if these contributions counted

---

#= <img src="pictures/Emoji_u1f44f.svg">


Note: What if these contributions were accolates
---
@ gh_start.png


Note: you have a profile
---
@ gh_start1.png


Note: What if you could change your profile
---
@ gh_start2.png

Note: What if you could curate a list of repositories you were proud to have worked on

---
@ gh_start3a.png

Note: And add ones that would otherwise fall off the end because they don't have enough stars?
---
@ gh_start3.png

Note: What if your contributions outside your namespace could be curated?

---
@ gh_start4.png

Note: What if you could list what you were proud to have worked on

---
@ gh_start5.png

Note: What if you could add things that you had interacted with, but not committed code to

---
@ gh_start6.png


Note: What if you could display that the owners of the project had given you accolades for your work?

What if, as a project owner, you could give props to community members

---

@ gh_start7.png

Note: What if the gamification goal was community help, not a full green graph
---

@ question.svg

Note: But how can you find who in your project community to give props to?

The customisation of the github profile may not exist, but the data for who could be given props does
