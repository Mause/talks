#> $ python

#> >>> Sophia 
#> 'fantastic'

#>- $ python <br>>>> Zsófia = “fantasztikus"<br> File "<stdin>", line 1<br> &nbsp; Zsófia = “fantasztikus"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;^<br>SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Note: if you wanted to do unicode in python, it won't work for things like variable names with non-ascii characters

#> $ python

#> >>> Sophia 
#> 'fantastic'

#>- $ python3<br>>>> Zsófia = "fantasztikus"<br>>>> Zsófia<br> 'fantasztikus'
