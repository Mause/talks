#= How to<br>be nice
##= [demo]

Note: Live demo, lets hope this works

Hat Rack 
---

#= How to<br>say thank you
##= [demo]

Note: 
Squees and blushes


---
#= How not<br>to react
##= &nbsp;

Note: 


---
#= Why can't we take a compliment?

---

#= Minimisation

Note: Antonym of exaggeration

"She'll be right, no worries"

Understating

---
#= Tall Poppy<br>Syndrome

Note: We are reluctant to allow ourselves to be elevated in front of our peers, lest we be cut down.

And of course, everyone's favourite

---

#= Imposter<br>Syndrome

Note: If we get thanked, we tend not to think it actually applies, because all the problems

---

#= Acknowledging our local wonders

Note: We are amazing. We are splendid. We need to ack that. 

The fact that I didn't know half of these existed is a problem in itself.

#= Acknowledging within a project

Note: You don't have to have a grand award, but you can do something small for people

---

@^ beeware_coins.png

Note: The beeware project has a Challenge coin that you get when you contribute to the project

Any contribution, it doesn't have to be code. 
---

#= Acknowledging the little things
Note: you don't have to win an award to be awesome
---

@ happiness_packet.png
## &nbsp; <!-- .slide: data-background="#f64747" data-background-transition="none" -->

Note: djangocon europe

happiness packets. io

A nice little message

and privacy settings to share or not share
---

#= Acknowledging our *own* achievements

Note: one way to break this is to start to acknowledge our own achievements

---
@ MyDonut.jpg

Note: Lara Hogan, Donut Manifesto

This donut = draft of a book

Giving ourselves a little celebration if noone else will

Tweeting the donut

Piggybacking on a picture of a donut (instagram makes this OK). 

I like the idea of donuts. This is one I did the other day.

I'm not trying to be self-gratifying, but sometimes, you need to do that.

---

#= But why say<br>thank you?

Note: Apart from it being a nice thing todo. 

---


#= It's nice thing to do

Note: Not getting acknowedgement sucks

Burnout

Plight of the organiser
---

#= Encourage<br>continued<br>engagement

Note: They have done a thing once, they will do it again.

Charelle's story from Compcon - first commit, hand held from Russell
---

#= Change<br>self image

Note:
it makes them feel valued

self image change, they feel included in the project, and it makes them feel good

but it also binds their fate to yours

if your project fails, it reflects badly on them, because they are now involed in your project


---

! question

Note: But just how can we say thank you

---

#= Communication<br>within<br>your project

Note: Mentioning things in your release notes is a good thing. MediaGolbin does this

Drupal concatenates thread commentors into git commit message

But the scope of this communication is only within your existing community. 

You need to extend to more general communications 
---
#= Communication<br>&ast;outside&ast;<br>your project

---
#= Give your helpers something to show for their work

---
@^ b_linked.png

Note: This is the new age resume. Publically accessible. We can thank people who would otherwise be unrecognised

LinkedIn is pretty awful though. 

---

#= Recommendations<br>vs<br>Endorsements

Note: Two main ways to add content to someone's linkedin profile

---
#= Recommendations

---

@^ linked_in_sections_recommendable.svg

Note: But here are the only ones that are able to be recommendable

---


@^ Linked_in_EE_only.svg

Note: Running a conf, volenteering as a thing, is **experience** 

LIST IT AS SUCH

#= Endorsements

#= User<br>Contributions

---

@^ github_glasnt_one.png

Note: this is the current github profile page. It's been vastly improved in the last few years
---
@^ github_glasnt_two.png

Note: you can now edit what repos show up, which is seeded from a list of anything
you've contributed to, even if it's just raised an issue, which is wonderful

---
@^ github_glasnt_three.png
Note: you can also alter if you want your private contribution counts to show up on your graph
---
@^ github_glasnt_four.png
Note: but what is in that graph
---

#= What counts?
##- Commits*
##- Issues&#42; and Pull Requests&#42;

Note: 

Issues created by you

Pull requests created or closed by you

commits to master by you

forks dont count

comments don't count

has to be linked to email

wiki contribs don't count


---

#= Sound too hard?

---
#>  $ pip install rockstar
#>- $ rockstar

- <img src="pictures/greensgreensgreens.png">


Note: Because creating a new repo and backdating a bunch of commits is a thing
you can do to fake your profile



---
#= What if... 


Note: 

---
@^ github_glasnt_one.png
---
@^ github_glasnt_nogreen.png
Note: Remove it.

##= <code>github.com<br>##.contributions-tab <br>> .flush.boxed-group</code>

## glasnt.com/block
Note: But what about the projects?

---
#= Project<br>Contributions

---

@= reveal_header.png

Note: Looking at any github project page we can see all the contributors right?


---
@= reveal_header_e.png

Note: ttere's a button right at the top and everything

---

@= reveal_contrib_top.png

Note: But if we click it, then we don't actually get the contributors

We get the top ones, with a graph, ranked by lines of code

---
@= reveal_contrib_top_e.png
---
@= reveal_contrib_bottom.png
---
@= reveal_contrib_bottom_e.png

Note: And it's only the top 100

---

#= This is only some of the contributors
Note: Not even all the code commiters are listed!
---
#= This is only some of the contributions
Note: What about everything else

---

#= What about<br>everything else?
---
##= Logged Issues
##- Unmerged Pull Requests
##- Code Reviews
##- Feature Discussions
##- Feature Voting
##- Wiki editing

---
! question

Note: But how can you find who in your project community to give props to?

The customisation of the github profile may not exist, but the data for who could be given props does
