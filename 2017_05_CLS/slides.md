 <div style='width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/question.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: But how do we track all these contributions that we make

---

 <div style='margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img src='pictures/github.svg'></p></div>  <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: GitHub gives us some of this functionality

Pretty graphs and the like

---

 <div style='margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img src='pictures/github-a.svg'></p></div>  <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: but it's not exactly perfect

And it only include itself

There are other ways - project specific, etc

---

 <div style='width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/question.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: But what about everything else?

Code Review / Documentation

Testing / Design

Promotion 

User Groups / Presentations

conferences

Community, yo

---

 <div style='width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/help.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: So, how can we track and record and acknowledge all this?

---

 <img src="pictures/leslie.png" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: Let me tell you about Leslie

Amazing human being

# #LABHR <!-- .slide: class="center" -->
## bit.do/LABHR

Note: She started this hashtag, and wrote a blog post about it

---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_0.svg" />

<span class="dasfoot">#LABHR</span>
Note: So Leslie + Blog = 5 steps

Note: GRAVY #3

Do it for someone not like you

if you're a coder, for your QA

mentors to mentees

<span class="dasfoot">#LABHR</span>
Note: Simple! Nice! Helpful!

---

 <img src="pictures/halp.svg" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: So, how can you do this in the real world

# Minimisation <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: Antonym of exaggeration

"She'll be right, no worries"

Understating 

---
# Tall Poppy<br>Syndrome <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: We are reluctant to allow ourselves to be elevated in front of our peers, lest we be cut down.

And of course, everyone's favourite

---

# Imposter<br>Syndrome <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: If we get thanked, we tend not to think it actually applies, because all the problems

---

# Acknowledging our local wonders <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: We are amazing. We are splendid. We need to ack that.

The fact that I didn't know half of these existed is a problem in itself.

# Acknowledging within a project <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: You don't have to have a grand award, but you can do something small for people

---

 <img src="pictures/beeware_coins.png" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: The beeware project has a Challenge coin that you get when you contribute to the project

Any contribution, it doesn't have to be code.

# Acknowledging the little things <!-- .slide: class="center" -->
Note: you don't have to win an award to be awesome

A nice little message

and privacy settings to share or not share

# Acknowledging our *own* achievements <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: one way to break this is to start to acknowledge our own achievements

 <img src="pictures/MyDonut.jpg" />

Note: Lara Hogan, Donut Manifesto

This donut = draft of a book

Giving ourselves a little celebration if noone else will

Tweeting the donut

Piggybacking on a picture of a donut (instagram makes this OK).

I like the idea of donuts. This is one I did the other day.

I'm not trying to be self-gratifying, but sometimes, you need to do that.

---

# But why say<br>thank you? <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: Apart from it being a nice thing todo.

---


# It's nice thing to do <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: Not getting acknowedgement sucks

Burnout 

Plight of the organiser

# Encourage<br>continued<br>engagement <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: They have done a thing once, they will do it again.

Charelle's story from Compcon - first commit, hand held from Russell
---

# Change<br>self image <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: 
it makes them feel valued

self image change, they feel included in the project, and it makes them feel good

but it also binds their fate to yours

if your project fails, it reflects badly on them, because they are now involed in your project


---

 <div style='width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/question.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: But just how can we say thank you

---

# Communication<br>within<br>your project <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: Mentioning things in your release notes is a good thing. MediaGolbin does this

Drupal concatenates thread commentors into git commit message

But the scope of this communication is only within your existing community.

You need to extend to more general communications
---
# Communication<br>&ast;outside&ast;<br>your project <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

# Give your helpers something to show for their work <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: This is the new age resume. Publically accessible. We can thank people who would otherwise be unrecognised

LinkedIn is pretty awful though.

---
# Recommendations <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: But here are the only ones that are able to be recommendable

---


 <img src="pictures/Linked_in_EE_only.svg" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: Running a conf, volenteering as a thing, is **experience**

LIST IT AS SUCH

 <img src="pictures/github_glasnt_one.png" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: this is the current github profile page. It's been vastly improved in the last few years
---
 <img src="pictures/github_glasnt_two.png" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: you can now edit what repos show up, which is seeded from a list of anything
you've contributed to, even if it's just raised an issue, which is wonderful

---
 <img src="pictures/github_glasnt_three.png" style="margin-top: -50px" />
Note: you can also alter if you want your private contribution counts to show up on your graph
---
 <img src="pictures/github_glasnt_four.png" style="margin-top: -50px" />
Note: but what is in that graph
---

# What counts? <!-- .slide: class="center" -->
## Commits* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
## Issues&#42; and Pull Requests&#42; <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: 

Issues created by you

Pull requests created or closed by you

commits to master by you

forks dont count

comments don't count

wiki contribs don't count

you can do to fake your profile

 <div style='margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img src='pictures/reveal_header.png'></p></div>  <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: Looking at any github project page we can see all the contributors right?


---
 <div style='margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img src='pictures/reveal_header_e.png'></p></div>  <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: ttere's a button right at the top and everything

---

 <div style='margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img src='pictures/reveal_contrib_top.png'></p></div>  <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: But if we click it, then we don't actually get the contributors

We get the top ones, with a graph, ranked by lines of code

---

The customisation of the github profile may not exist, but the data for who could be given props does
