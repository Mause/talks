This is the code point for the dragon emoji

I can't send you this dragon, sadly.

But I can send you the reference code point to this dragon, and your phone, tablet, laptop will intepret that codepoint, and display *a* dragon

But it might not be this dragon

It depends on what operating system your device is using

The thing is, HTC and Samsung have their own emoji

If oyu have an android phone by a different manufacturer

Note: your dragon will look like this

But if you have an iphone, your dragon will look completely different

Note: older apples will look like this

and newer ones

---

 <img height='400px' src='pictures/dragon/apple.png'> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: will look like this

But it doesn't matter what platform you have if you're using certain social media platforms

Because they have their own emoji!

Note: There are ten different dragons here, and that's not even counting if you have an older version of windows, if you're running linux, if you have custom emoji sets...

And here's the thing. They all look like dragons. I mean, sure, some look more european, and others look more like traditional Long dragons, but they're all dragons.

And depending on if you're using facebook on the web or messenger your dragon will change between chinese and medieval... but they're all dragons.

I mean, sure, a few of them are charging up ball lightning for some reason, but they're all dragons

It's when you start trying to use only emoji to communicate that you get issues.

For example, if you were to send the message: I feel powerful, with a dragon on the end... are you being
---

 <img height='400px' src='pictures/dragon/apple.png'> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: literal? I feel so powerful I'm bristling with power!


---

 <img height='400px' src='pictures/dragon/htc.png'> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: sarcastic? Feeling bloated and tired and a bit green around the gills...
---

# &nbsp;

Note: yeah, okay, I might be pushing this anology with dragons, but this happens all the time in real life

For example: I get to speak at PyCon TW!

 <div style='width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/t/grimace.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: What am I trying to say here?

This face to me seems... slightly anguished?

Maybe I meant another face..
---

 <div style='width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/t/grinning.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: this is only just slightly better to me, but that mouth seems wrong, and not the emoji I'd chose to describe my actual feeling: excitement

---

 <div style='width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/t/grimace.svg'><img height='400px' src='pictures/t/grinning.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: this particular pair of emoji are Grimace and Grinning

In older versions of emoji these codepoints were represeneted in ways where they could be easily confused

So much so that there was a research study on exactly this

“Blissfully happy” or “ready to fight”: Varying Interpretations of Emoji

From the University of Minnesota

It found that while the misintepretation across different platforms were problematic, as we've already seen with our dragons, there were issues with different emoji within the same platform.

For this partiuclar instance this has been fixed


---

 <div style='width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/t/grimace_new.svg'><img height='400px' src='pictures/t/beaming.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: Nearly every platform has ensured that the grinning face with smiling eyes emoji has a mouth that suits

But there are still emoji that can be confused with each other.

For example:

---

# &nbsp;

Note: A message from a relative letting you know that the family pet is in hosptial

---


 <div style='width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/t/tearsjoy.svg'><img height='400px' src='pictures/space.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: crying happy face

... Not sure that's the one you meant, honey...

---

 <div style='width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/t/tearsjoy.svg'><img height='400px' src='pictures/t/loudcry.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: you probably meant Loudly crying face

I mean, sure, you can see the subtle differences here when they're big on a projector screen

The mouths are different, sure, but if you're typing this out on a phone you're not getting a good resolution to view the differences
---


<div style='width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='40px' src='pictures/t/tearsjoy.svg'><img height='40px' src='pictures/t/loudcry.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->


Note: your phone's emoji keynote is TINY and so it's easy to not ever see the differences

It's so very important to make sure you're not allowing the intepretation of your message to hang in the balance of an emoji.

Note: There's another issue wrapped up in here that I want to talk about.

And that's where emoji come from

 <div style='width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/g/japan.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: the simple answer is Japan!

But there's a long and complicated answer that describes why the confusion with the eyes happens.
