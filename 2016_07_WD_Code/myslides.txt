SHI-GE-TA-KA  KU RI TA

12x12 pixels

Introduced in the early 1990s, with a whole lot of turmoil

There's entire essays on the implementatation issues with this

Emoji Added to Unicode 6, 2010

TLDR: Apple implemented the proposed unicode spec with emoji for japan only

then a couple of versions later, released to the US

And then everyone rampted up

Note: here's where it gets (more) complicated
---

! g/dash
Note: I posit that the unicode adoption, particularly the graphics and implementations was a bit rushed.

and this has been depremental to emoji


Especially with the original android adoption
---
! o/stdyellow.png | g/yellow

Yellow Heart

This is the Apple version

Here's what Android went with.

an iWatch, Earbuds, an iPhone and an iMac.

Nope.

My Android - 5.0.1 OS --> U7.0 if you're lucky

Yosemite - up to 6.1, plus vulcan

Linux in general... yeah no.

Old systems in general

Note:
Also Emojili - a hack as a joke, but they were approched by VCs


They had an iphone and android app

Electromagnetic field talk about the fun they had trying to create this bodge

---
! e/web

Note: In the webspace, you have a few options

You can have your own input keyboard in the web space

Twitter DMs have a few, facebook has a menu in their webview

Google and Docs have menus, but their implementation is a bit.. weird

It's one of the older ones, and it looks like they're using private space

The emoji in your drafts, or in the edit mode, aren't emoji

But they're saved as it.

---
! t/shortcake

Note: workaround for having a visual input mechanism is shortcodes

But they're a psudostandard



---

! g/colon | g/C | g/A | g/K | g/E | g/colon
- <img src="pictures/a/cake.png">

Note: Shortcodes

Slack: Searchable if they are native
auto convert from emoji codepoints to emoticons

Github: shortcodes, no search, autocomplete only.


Django-emoji is an app for Django that reports to do this

! g/lbrack | g/C | g/A | g/K | g/E | g/rbrack

Note: HipChat

uses brackets instead

---

! a/cake.png | g/notequal | a/birthdaycake.png

Note:

Cross-platform incompatibility
Interetinsg to see when slack codes go into hipchat

Also, slack engineering using slack codes in medium

Also, hipchat api calls - slash commands are broken in 4.0 clients, but emoticons still work -__

---

! e/automobile | e/tick

Note: on that note, please make automatically changing arbitaary text to emoji optional

please let me disable autocorrect

---

! e/control

Note: On the web,you have complete control

You can control the entire system

You can make it work

You can make it display your own emoji, or use a common one, like Emoji One

---

! m/suggestion
Note:
If i might make a suggestion

if you have to do this kind of thing
---
! g/fall | t/back
Note: Fall Back

Don't rely on system emoji for the web. It's unreliable, and exclusionary

You could try and detect if the emoji won't work via the User Agent, or

Just serve your own emoji graphs

Yes, it's not the best way to get things done, but

Note: Actual Emoji 
One from every release of unicode from 1993 - 2016

Chrome, Firefox, Safari evergreen all on el cap
: none of them look the same

---
! g/wave | g/lightbulb

Note: Alt - Highlight

Have the unicode character as the alt

Allows copy and pasting

---
! g/mouse | t/over

Note: Tooltip - Mouse Over

Have the proper description there, the standard

Alt Text does not have the same functionality as Tool Tips


You can use this to your own advantage

NEW

Twitter implements all these on the web

As long as you are using a browser that runs javascript and can display images, Twitter will work every emoji.

---

! t/web | t/wheelchair
Note:
Think of it in terms of web accessibilty

At the very least, have images that are distinct and visible

little 12x12 don't work

Use vector graphs where possible - Apple doesnt

Where you can, allow the images to be bigger

Twitter DM and Slack message - if only emoji, they're display bigger
