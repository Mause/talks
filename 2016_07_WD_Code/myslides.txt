Note: Shigetaka Kurita

SHI-GE-TA-KA  KU RI TA

12x12 pixels 

Introduced in the early 1990s, with a whole lot of turmoil

There's entire essays on the implementatation issues with this

Emoji Added to Unicode 6, 2010

TLDR: Apple implemented the proposed unicode spec with emoji for japan only

then a couple of versions later, released to the US

And then everyone rampted up

Note: CLAPPING HANDS SIGN

Python Code

Much work to get unicode integrated into systems

The picture here is the image form the standard

if i run the python code in Apple, i get the apple version

---
! t/apple | a/mobile.png

Note: Apple implemented emoji when they etered the japanese market

Didn't add to US iPhones for years, ~2010

People have used emoji *SO MUCH* since then

All ages

even important people like

Julie Bishop - Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs

Shes done entire interview in emoji

---

!  e/robot | g/mobile 

Note: Sending SMS apple to apple works, but then you get cross compatibility issues

---

! e/microscope

Note: after inspection and research, I have developed an assertion
---

! g/dash
Note: I posit that the unicode adoption, particularly the graphics and implementations was a bit rushed. 

and this has been depremental to emoji 


Especially with the original android adoption

---

! g/sweat

Note: It's an incredible responsibility, but android got it very wrong in the beginning

Note:

Std vs 4.4 vs 5.0 Andoird IMplementations

Here's their 4.4 vs 5 implementations

The theory is that the black/white sample was used directly,


assumed to be stubble

but that doesn't explain the rest of them.

! a/flushed.png | t/flushed | e/flushed | g/flushed

Note: 
This isn't the only one that's not exactly the same

Completely different

! a/bow.png | a/information.png | a/nogood.png | a/ok.png
Note: 

But there are cultural emoji that are completely foreign to the western world.

Person bowing deeply 


information desk

No good

OK
---
! t/minidisc | t/floppy | t/fax | t/cardindex 

Note: Emoji was also created in the early 90s

so there's outdated tech in the standard which is 

included for backwarsd compatility

minidisc

floppy disc

fax machine

rolodex

COMING UP

terrifying out of context
---
! m/kissing

Note: Terrifying out of context

Mozilla have their own emoi set

an iWatch, Earbuds, an iPhone and an iMac.

Nope.

Yosemite - up to 6.1, plus vulcan

Linux in general... yeah no.

Note: Apple input Control CMD Space

Not universal

Some apps don't like it

Sourced from Swedish camping map

Place of intereste

---

! e/web

Note: In the webspace, you have a few options

You can have your own input keyboard in the web space

Twitter DMs have a few, facebook has a menu in their webview

Google and Docs have menus, but their implementation is a bit.. weird

It's one of the older ones, and it looks like they're using private space

The emoji in your drafts, or in the edit mode, aren't emoji

But they're saved as it.

---
! t/shortcake

Note: workaround for having a visual input mechanism is shortcodes

But they're a psudostandard



---

! g/colon | g/C | g/A | g/K | g/E | g/colon
- <img src="pictures/a/cake.png">

Note: Shortcodes

Slack: Searchable if they are native
auto convert from emoji codepoints to emoticons

Github: shortcodes, no search, autocomplete only.


Django-emoji is an app for Django that reports to do this


---

! g/lbrack | g/C | g/A | g/K | g/E | g/rbrack
- <img src="pictures/a/birthdaycake.png">

Note: HipChat

uses brackets instead

---

! a/cake.png | g/notequal | a/birthdaycake.png

Note: 

Cross-platform incompatibility
Interetinsg to see when slack codes go into hipchat

Also, slack engineering using slack codes in medium

Also, hipchat api calls - slash commands are broken in 4.0 clients, but emoticons still work -__

---

! e/automobile | e/tick

Note: on that note, please make automatically changing arbitaary text to emoji optional

Note: On the web,you have complete control

You can control the entire system

You can make it work

You can make it display your own emoji, or use a common one, like Emoji One

---

! m/suggestion
Note:
If i might make a suggestion

if you have to do this kind of thing 
 
---
! t/wheelchair

Note: 

Think of it in terms of web accessibilty

At the very least, have images that are distinct and visible

little 12x12 don't work

Use vector graphs where possible - Apple doesnt

Where you can, allow the images to be bigger

Twitter DM and Slack message - if only emoji, they're display bigger
---
! g/fall | t/back
Note: Fall Back

Don't rely on system emoji for the web. It's unreliable, and exclusionary

You could try and detect if the emoji won't work via the User Agent, or

Just serve your own emoji graphs

Yes, it's not the best way to get things done, but 



---
! g/wave | g/lightbulb

Note: Alt - Highlight

Have the unicode character as the alt

Allows copy and pasting

---
! g/mouse | t/over

Note: Tooltip - Mouse Over

Have the proper description there, the standard

Alt Text does not have the same functionality as Tool Tips 


You can use this to your own advantage

NEW

Twitter implements all these on the web

As long as you are using a browser that runs javascript and can display images, Twitter will work every emoji.

---

! g/twisted

Note: 
twist things around

why don't we just have a hardware solution?

---
# &nbsp; <!-- .slide: data-background="pictures/emoji_keyboard.jpg" data-background-transition="none" -->

Hardware keyboard x 14  + LUA script + Autohotkey

They had an iphone and android app
