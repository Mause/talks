## How to handle abandoned projects

#= Hi!

Note: This is totally based on a true story. It happened to a friend of a friend of mine.



# &nbsp;




#= "Just fork it!"
##- Well, it's not that simple



##=- GitHub Forking
##- Licencing
##- 'Competitor' Code
##- Dead Source



# GitHub Forking
##- <img src="pictures/github_forking.gif">
Note: Github's forking != Traditional Forking




# Limitations
#
##- Parent Lock-in
##- Default Pull Requests
##- No Issue Logging
##- Commits Don't Count

Note: Parent - perma link to source
PR - defaults to parent, accidently attempt to merge upstream
Issues - physical limitation on workflow
Commits - you can work your butt off and your green graph doesn't fill up



# Licencing
#- BSD



# Licencing
# BSD?

Note: 
 * "Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted"
  - well, yay! I can just have at it!
 * "provided that the following conditions are met: "
  - ah, the caveats




# BSD3 - Can:
##- Commercially Use
##- Modifiy & Distribute
##- Sublicence
##- Place Warranty
Note: Tldr - yay opensource!



# BSD3 - Cannot:
##- Use Trademark
##- Hold Liable
Note: Fair Enough



# BSD3 - Must:
##- Include Copyright
##- <img src="pictures/awkward.gif">
Note: Follows onto the next slide




# 'Competitor' Code
##- &copy; Their Company 2014
##- &copy; Your Company 2015

Note: having copyrights with other company's copyright is kinda a weird thing, amiright?




# Dead Source
##- <img src="pictures/tumbleweed.gif"> 

Note: If the source upstream is dead, then that's an inhibitor of innovation




#= So what could you do?



#= Ask.
Note: This is totally what I did. Because this happened to me. Saddest of Panda



# So what could they do?
##- Transfer ownership


# Transferring of GitHub Repos
##- Create a new organisation
##- Add Admin from their organisation
##- They transfer repo into your organisation
##- Remove them from your organisation



# Resulting State
##- All the PRs, Issues, Commits stay
##- Automatic 301 Redirect to new location
##- You now have the commit bit :D




#= So why do you care?




!#= PHP 7




#= So what can you do?
## Abandon Responsibly
## Restore Dead Code




# Abandon Responsibly
##- Update your README
##- Mark as Inactive
##- Link to a better solution
##- Assign a New Maintainer





# Restore Dead Code
##- Check their README

# Restore Dead Code
## Check their README
##- Is it inactive?
##- Is there a better solution?
##- Can you be the new maintainer?
