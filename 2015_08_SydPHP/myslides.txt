#= Life After Death
## How to handle abandoned projects
<img src="pictures/footer.svg">

Note: Breathe. Slow.

#= Hi!

Note: This is totally based on a true story. It happened to a friend of a friend of mine.

---

# &nbsp;

Note: Say you have a project

You find a cool widget on GitHub

You want to use it.

But..

It hasn't been updated in 4 years

There's cobwebs all over it

It should do what you want

But it needs changes

---


#= "Just fork it!"
##- Well, it's not that simple

---

#= GitHub doesn't<br>do "Forking"

Note: They don't implement the traditional forking methodology

We'll get to that

---

#= Plus, there's more issues.

---

##=- GitHub Forking
##- Licensing
##- 'Competitor' Code
##- Dead Source


Note: We'll discuss all these things

---

# GitHub Forking
##- <img src="pictures/github_forking.gif">
Note: Github's forking != Traditional Forking

It's your copy for branches and PR merges. 

It's not a full working copy of a code base
---

# Limitations
##- Parent Lock-in
##- Default Pull Requests
##- No Issue Logging by Default
##- Commits Don't Count

Note: Parent - perma link to source. Network Graph

PR - defaults to parent, accidently attempt to merge upstream


Issues - CORRECTION - issues are disabled by default, but can be enabled.

Commits - you can work your butt off and your green graph doesn't fill up


---


# Licensing
!#- BSD-3

Note: Licensing is fun. If you have no licence, it defaults to All Rights Reserved

ARR means you own the copyright, and noone else can have it

So, that's no fun. Let's use BSD as an example

Berkeley Software Distribution 3 Clause License

# Licensing
!# BSD-3?

---
# 'Competitor' Code
##- &copy; Their Company 2014
##- &copy; Your Company 2015

Note: having copyrights with other company's copyright is kinda a weird thing, amiright?

---

# Dead Source
##- <img src="pictures/tumbleweed.gif"> 

Note: If the source upstream is dead, then that's an inhibitor of innovation


No merges ever, no changes. Nerfed fork, very limited play
---


#= So what could you do?
---

!#= Ask.

Note: This is totally what I did. Because this happened to me. Saddest of Panda


Possible solutions: transfer of ownership, proper copy fork with attribution, many other

---

#= So why should<br>you care?

---

!#= PHP 7

Note: PHP5 will die. PHP4 shuold already be dead.

When everyone upgrades, the old code needs to come along, or it'll be lost.

Not just PHP

---

#= Ruby 1.8, 1.9.3 EOL
##- <p> Example: <code>pry-debugger</code></p>

Note: EOL languages. Things have migrated on

pry-debugger - only works with 1.x

Was the go to debugger now not so much

Top of README says: 2.0? use byebug

you shouldn't be using 1.8, 1.9.3 anyway, EOL

---

#= Python 3 

##- Supported in < 10% of packages

Note:  Per PyCon US Guido keynote

Once 2.7 goes EOL, then projects can't be used any more.

No satisfaction in just porting it

long tail of dependencies prohibit porting

There are automated tools for this

---

#= Non-Language Dependent Factors

Note: There's other things that could happen

---

#= Google Code
##- Read Only

Note: Not accepting new projects as of January. 


Read Only as of Aug 24 (Tuesday ish Australia time)

Had a few months, but now anything on there is R/O


--- 

#= SourceForge

Note: VLC binaries 'abandoned', being updated w/out consent, with spyware

Also, small two week outage in there


---


#= Every active project is going to need love


Note: 'active' meaning someone's using it, who's moving to the new structure

The maintainer may be off growing grapes

Hostile Forks Don't Help

---

#= So what can you do?
##- Abandon Responsibly
##- Restore Dead Code

Note: If you have a project vs if you see a project

---

# Abandon Responsibly
##- Update your README
##- Mark as inactive
##- Link to a better solution
##- Leave a forwarding address
##- Assign a new maintainer

Note: Documentation is your friend

You don't want people coming across your stuff when there's something better

You really don't want people using code that has deps with known vuls

---

#= GitHub Ownership Transfer

Note: Create a new/existing organisation

Add the admin from the otehr one in (shared rights)

Transfer

Remove new admin

---

# Benefits
##- All the PRs, Issues, Commits stay
##- 301 Redirects to new URL
##- You get the commit bit :D


Note: the 301 is very nice, it will automatically users to the new repo based on the old URL

This may break if you attempt to overload the old namespace, however. 

---


# Restore Dead Code
##- Check their README
##- <img src="pictures/notdeadyet.gif">


---

# Restore Dead Code
## Check their README
##- Is it inactive?
##- Is there a better solution?
##- Can you be the new maintainer?

Note: check the history. 

Check if the latest release was stable. 

Check if they've mentioned anything in the latest notes

Check if they suggest anything more in their read me

See if they are looking for someone

Do they have an IRC channel? A mailing list?

---

#= There's probably<br>more factors in play

Note: It's never just that simple.

Politics

Friendships

Pet Projects

---

#= Go to rule:<br>There's nothing wrong<br>with being nice. 

Note: the ability to openly communicate is one facet of opensource that makes it amazing

They've put in the effort to make a solution that's usefulness is expiring

Help make their solution timeless.

---

#= Thanks!
