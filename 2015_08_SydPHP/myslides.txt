#= Life After Death
## How to handle abandoned projects

#= Hi!

Note: This is totally based on a true story. It happened to a friend of a friend of mine.

---

# &nbsp;

Note: Say you have a project

You find a cool widget on GitHub

You want to use it.

But..

It hasn't been updated in 4 years

---


#= "Just fork it!"
##- Well, it's not that simple

---

#= GitHub doesn't do Forking

Note: They don't implement the traditional forking methodology

---

#= Plus, there's more issues.

---

##=- GitHub Forking
##- Licencing
##- 'Competitor' Code
##- Dead Source

---

# GitHub Forking
##- <img src="pictures/github_forking.gif">
Note: Github's forking != Traditional Forking

---

# Limitations
##- Parent Lock-in
##- Default Pull Requests
##- No Issue Logging
##- Commits Don't Count

Note: Parent - perma link to source

PR - defaults to parent, accidently attempt to merge upstream

Issues - physical limitation on workflow

Commits - you can work your butt off and your green graph doesn't fill up


---


# Licencing
!#- BSD


---
# Licencing
!# BSD?

Note:
 
"Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted"

well, yay! I can just have at it!

"provided that the following conditions are met: "

ah, the caveats

---

# BSD3 - Can:
##- Commercially Use
##- Modifiy & Distribute
##- Sublicence
##- Place Warranty
Note: Tldr - yay opensource!

---

# BSD3 - Cannot:
##- Use Trademark
##- Hold Liable
Note: Fair Enough

---

# BSD3 - Must:
##- Include Copyright
##- <img src="pictures/awkward.gif">

---
# 'Competitor' Code
##- &copy; Their Company 2014
##- &copy; Your Company 2015

Note: having copyrights with other company's copyright is kinda a weird thing, amiright?

---

# Dead Source
##- <img src="pictures/tumbleweed.gif"> 

Note: If the source upstream is dead, then that's an inhibitor of innovation

---


#= So what could you do?
---

!#= Ask.

Note: This is totally what I did. Because this happened to me. Saddest of Panda

---

#= So why do you care?

---

!#= PHP 7

Note: PHP5 will die. PHP4 shuold already be dead.

When everyone upgrades, the old code needs to come along, or it'll be lost.

---

#= So what can you do?
##- Abandon Responsibly
##- Restore Dead Code

Note: If you have a project vs if you see a project

---

# Abandon Responsibly
##- Update your README
##- Mark as Inactive
##- Link to a better solution
##- Leave a forwarding address
##- Assign a New Maintainer

Note: Documentation is your friend

You don't want people coming across your stuff when there's something better

---

#= On the transfer of ownership

Note: Here's how you move things in GitHub

---

# Transfer ownership
##- Create a new organisation
##- Add new admin
##- Transfer repo
##- Remove new admin

Note: You create a new organisation

Then, you add someone w/transfer rights into your new group, as an admin

Then, they transfer the repo between two organisations that they have the rights to do so with

Then, you remove them, before they can do anything else :)

---

# Resulting State
##- All the PRs, Issues, Commits stay
##- 301 Redirects to new URL
##- You get the commit bit :D


Note: the 301 is very nice, it will automatically users to the new repo based on the old URL

This may break if you attempt to overload the old namespace, however. 

---


# Restore Dead Code
##- Check their README
##- <img src="pictures/notdeadyet.gif">


---

# Restore Dead Code
## Check their README
##- Is it inactive?
##- Is there a better solution?
##- Can you be the new maintainer?

---

#= There's probably more factors in play

Note: It's never just that simple.

Politics

Friendships

Pet Projects

---

#= Go to rule: There's nothing wrong with being nice. 

Note: the ability to openly communicate is one facet of opensource that makes it amazing

---

#= Thanks!
