Note: so Eich made it look like Java, basing it a bit on Scheme and Self as well

Originally called LiveScript. Changed to JavaScript because it was kinda based on int

But Sun owned the trademark, so Sun owned the JavaScript trademark

Which is now owned by Oracle


Java could have been the language of the web

Note: Mosaic split into NetScape in SpyGlass

Netscape says: "we're going to wipe out MS!"

MS says: "whoops, buying spyglass"

race was on to develop the scriting language to make the web better
