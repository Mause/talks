Eich originally wanted to make scheme

Sure, they said

Oh wait, that's scheme, that's gross, don't do that.

###= JavaScript was developed in 10 days

### &nbsp;


Note: so Eich made it look like Java, basing it a bit on Scheme and Self as well

Originally called LiveScript. Changed to JavaScript because it was kinda based on int

But Sun owned the trademark, so Sun owned the JavaScript trademark

Which is now owned by Oracle


Java could have been the language of the web

Java Applets

###= JavaScript was developed in 10 days

### to offer a lightweight version of Java
### in order to compete for users with Microsoft

Note: Mosaic split into NetScape in SpyGlass

Netscape says: "we're going to wipe out MS!"

MS says: "whoops, buying spyglass"

race was on to develop the scriting language to make the web better

Because trademark, MS reverse engineered JS, called it JScript


---

##= ECMAScript Standard

Note: Because of some fun issues, Tim Berners Lee and W3C wouldn't do the standard
 
TBL was apparently upset that Netscape took his simple design and made it silly

with things like images and formatting



They ended up at the

European Computer Manufacturers Association

They couldn't think of a better name

Working title: ECMA Script (ecc-ma)

forced creation of `===`
