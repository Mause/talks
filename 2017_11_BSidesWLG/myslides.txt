Some of them, however...

Note: the standard apple bee. Sure, it looks like a bee, a bit cartoon, but okay. 7 out of 10

### EmojiOne 2.2

Note: This bee is also cute as heck. This one is from EmojiOne, a once free, not freemium open source emoji set

But this bee, while cute, is superseded.

! space | bee_google_4.png | space
## Android 4.4

Note: this bee is my favourite, he's just so happy to see you. 10 out of 10, keep buzzing my friend. 

Sadly, as you may have heard or seen, the cute blob android emoji have been replaced with 'normal' emoji...\

I say 'normal', because the faces are very much styled similar to the apple emoji.. .

and yet...

---

Note: ... see a problem?

It's an exorsist bee

WAT


and then you have the just.. strage ones...

Note: The emojidex bee though... I think he's playing some variation of quiddich

Or he's a red teamer with his honeypot there.

##= The Power and Responsibility
##=of Unicode Adoption
Note: 
"The power and responsibility of UNicode adoption"

I first gave it at this very meetup in March last year. 

I know right? It sounds like a proper technical talk, but it's actually me just yelling about emoji and stuff

Thing is, that's not the name
---

##= The Power <img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="pictures/o/bolt.svg" width="60px"> and Responsibility <img style="margin-bottom: 0px" width="60px" src="pictures/g/sweat.svg">
##= of Unicode Adoption <img style="margin-bottom: 0px" width="50px" src="pictures/t/sparkles.svg">

Note: this is the name.  it has emoji in the title

This has caused me all *sorts* of fun when trying to propose and present at conferences


---

@ djangoconeu_accept.png

Note: For example, some conferences can't get the name right, even when it's been entered into their system 

---

@ easychair.png

Note: Some like some characters, but not others

I had to resubmit this one and remove specific characters

---

@ kiwicon_cfp.png

Note: Some just get a little bit corrupted (kiwicon)
---

@ pyconau_schedule_list.png
Note: but sometimes it works!

... on the website
---
@ pcau_2.jpg
Note: but not on the printed schedule
---

@ pcau_3.jpg
Note: or on the AV notes. 

Side note, it's REALLY fun when the person introducing you on stage reads that verbatim

---

@ bsides_schedule.jpg

---
@^ dw_2.jpg

Note: granted, sometimes they get it right!

@ djeu_5.jpg

Note: but sometimes it prints out wrong

---

Note: So sometimes they just cut it out entirely
---

@ djeu_1.jpg
@ djeu_2.jpg
Note: but they can be corrected

@ pcau_1.jpg
Note: But the best part is when the digital boards work

Because I can tell you exactly what operating system this is running. Windows 8

---
# &nbsp;
@ ms_sweat.png

Note: This is the emoji
---
@ sweat_versions.png

Note:

Different vendors have implemented emoji differently. In this case, the 'sweat drop' face is the most easily recognisable as windows, because it looks like a face with boils all over it or something

(picture of different sweat)

Based on this, we can guess the operating system, down to the version, using just the emoji being displayed.
---

! g/sweat

Note: So yeah, that's fun. 

But oyu don't have to submit talks to confs to test out platforms and their emoji support

---

Note: go back to bees
This is a hacker conf, yeah? while bees are awesome, what if we could hack with them?
---

@ bee-backpack.jpg

Note: you could attach tiny little microchips onto bees like sciencists in manchester did

they created an 

internet of stings

but this is fiddly

we should stick to our emoji

---
! e/thinking

Note:

but what is emoji

---

@ not_emoji.png


Note:
These are not emoji

So if, for example, you were to say download an executable claiming to give you an emoji pack for your favourite chat client, that's not hacking. That's you downloading a random executable and getting what's coming to you

---

<img src="pictures/facebook_sticker.gif" height="600px">

Note: These are not emoji. These are stickers. 

These are animated devils that some vendors make you pay for. 

These were cool back in Yahoo messenger 15 years ago. 

---

@ animoji_gif.gif

Note: this is not emoji. This is face detection as a gimick.

---

@ twitter_sticker.png

Note: these again, aren't emoji. These are twiter stickers, now, granted, 

---

@ twitter_sticker_emoji.png

Note: these *are emoji*, but in the official twitter client, they are literally there so you can cover up your image. 
For example

---

@ twitter_sticker_obscure.png

Note: you might do this so you can mask the identity of these two individuals, right?

Well no.

But it's not just thirdparty apps taht can cause trouble

Note: native functioanlity with emoji can crash your phone.
---
! t/rainbow_flag
Note: Who is familiar with the Pride Flag emoji that was just added?
---

! t/whiteflag | zwj | t/rainbow
Note: it's comprised of two existing emoji, the white flag and the rainbow, but with a special character

a Zero Width joiner, between them

You don't normally see this because in your flag picker, you see the end result. 

However

<span class="bfoot" style="bottom: -260px"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJLMSllzoLA">The Effective Power Bug (2015)</a></span>
Note: how this worked is that the words 'effective power' had no meaning, but the text after it, that's displaying weirdly here, would set it off

When this text appeared in a notification popup, the truncation of that message would happen part way in the stuff on the third line, and the phone would get confused and restart

but that's not hacking.

But notice something that's inconsistent?

<span class="bfoot" style="bottom: -180px"><a href="https://poststatus.com/the-trojan-emoji/">Anatomy of a Critical Security Bug</a></span>
Note: What is hacking is this wonderful incident I found involving mysql, not-strict tables, and wordpress

With literally a bug that could set the world on fire

---

##= `STRICT_ALL_TABLES`

Note: This could have all been avoided if STRICT TABLES had been enabled for wordpress


Wordpress core used some of the ... more interesting features of mysql, so they couldn't enable this, and this is why everthing was a fire

Note: 

This is our codepoint

---

! space | bee_google_4.png | space
## `\xf0\x9f\x90\x9d `
Note: 
The emoji uses four bytes

And there's a small issue in mysql when strict tables is turned off. If you try and insert an emoji it'll... truncate. 
---

##= `<q cite="Bees are cute` <img src="pictures/bee_google_4.png" style="width: 50px; margin-bottom: 0px;">`">`
## `BSides WLG is awesome</q>`

Note: So, say if you have a Wordpress blog that allows comments, and citations, and you have something like this, which would pass javascript validation because it's a complete tag

But because Mysql...
---
##= `<q cite="Bees are cute` &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color: white">.</span>

## &nbsp;

Note: It'd drop about here
---

##= `script src="honeypot.js">`

Note: which means that if your NEXT comment happens to be something like this

because that's not a script tag, there's no opening angle bracket

---
##= `<q cite="Bees are cute` 
##= `...`
##= `script src="honeypot.js">`
Note: you'd end up with a very large quote tag, that had a script attribute

sad trombone. 

---

! t/boom

---

#= `CVE-2015-3438`
Note: So that's CVE 2015 3 4 3 8

It's been patched as of WordPress 4.2, so please PATCH YOUR THINGS
Wordpress 4.2 introduced emoji natively into the system... and also removed a small issue with it breaking everything

but you get new emoji! you should update your things!
---
#= MySQL
