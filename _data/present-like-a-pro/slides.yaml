    text: Hi!

      I'm Katie, and I'm on the internet as "glasnt".
      I work in
      Developer Relations -- which is a fancy name for engineers that go out into the
      real world and talk to humans. Weird right?  In my role I have to do a lot of
      presentations, so I thought it would be a great idea to share some things that
      I hope will help you. And maybe get you interested in this whole speaking thing. This
      is collected wisdom from many sages, not just my own advice. Full sources will
      be shared at the end of this presentation, and there should be plenty of time
      for questions at the end. I'm more than happy to answer questions in the hallway
      and during sprints

      Giving a presentation in front of a crowd is intimidating. You are literally

      once you get going, you get through the first 10 seconds, you start being the
      star of the show, and you can deliver your amazing message.

      potential disappointment get the better of you, to mess up your demo, to misspeak
      or lose your place. But your audience won''t care about that. They will see
      your talk as successful if they leave having learnt something.'

      your content. ---- You could have a presentation about the most important
      topic in the world, but if you <i>deliver it with a monotone voice and
      being uninterested</i> then people will reflect that enthusiasm back at
      you. Slides are just a mechanism to help structure your content and re-inforce
      points. You can give a talk without slides, but you can't give a talk without
      talking!

      for myself. Your talk needs to have a "call to action": "try this thing", "consider
      using x thing". You can condense this into a toot or a blog post, but there''s
      power in a story, and the journey. And to give a presentation, you need a stage.'

      I highly recommend it!. But once you have your idea, and a potential event,
      you now have to bring the content.

      Which probably means slides. You don't have to have them. I like to have
      them. So let's talk about that. One time, my audience didn't notice my slides
      weren't progressing because my talk kept going like it was intentional. Fun
      times! --- Now we get to the part of the presentation where I'll start
      making suggestions at you.

    image: images/slide_17.png
    text:
      'Real talk: These suggestions are opinions, based on my experience, but also
      some pretty "well, duh" guidelines. Once you start doing public speaking,
      you''re going to have your own preferences, your own style. If you already
      have opinions that work for you, that''s great. Do that. But if you''re just
      starting out, here are some common best practices. This is also generally suited
      towards technical presentations at meetups or other community events. Outside
      of these venues, your mileage may vary. [I only have a short time with y''all,
      so sadly I can''t teach you my *entire* vocation, but hopefully at least enough
      to help you out] Also, as a kind reminder: if you notice anyone at this event
      do does things differently or in oppoisition to these tips, please don''t call
      them out on it. Additionally, if you''re in the room and are speaking later
      today, please don''t frantically change your slides based on these tips. Come
      back to them _after_ your talk.'
  - alt: Things to do.
    image: images/slide_18.png
    text: So. Things to do.
  - alt: Use one slide per minute*
    image: images/slide_19.png
    text:
      Aim for, on average, a slide per minute. Maybe up to 3 if you're feeling cheeky,
      but you don't want them to be distracting. Your audience wants to hear you
      speak, not a repeated mouse click as you advance your slides. Your slides
      are your signposts for your story. Depending on the story you want to tell, you
      want to give yourself a bit of room to breath or expand depending on the audience,
      so think of your slides as guardrails.
  - alt: One point.
    image: images/slide_20.png
    text:
      Pick the one thing you want people to remember after the talk. For your
      presentations, it might be "I did the thing!" or "Learn about this one weird trick!". You
      will be presenting for some time, and people won't remember your entire presentation
      word for word, so they will only take away a subset of your talk. Make the
      point memorable. Is it a link to a package or tool? Make sure the name of the
      thing is one a slide. And if it's something you want them to go to, a URL or
      QR code on the last slide is super useful! Also, post it on social media! "I
      did a talk! Learn more about X here".
  - alt: Don't assume.
    image: images/slide_21.png
    text:
      Don't assume the technical or prior knowledge level of your audience. Try
      and avoid the 'curse of knowledge'. Let's say you want to give a presentation
      at work about what you're building. You know everything about it. Your manager
      knows probably a lot about it, people outside your team a bit less, but other
      coworkers, not as much. So you're going to have to fill them in a bit.
  - alt: Fit your audience.
    image: images/slide_22.png
    text:
      Fit your audience. If you're presenting at a meetup, you can be a bit more
      casual than, say, an industry conference. But also think about the people
      in the room. A room of programmers are going to, probably, have a of prior
      knowledge that you can leverage. You *probably* don't have to explain what
      programming languages are. That being said, if you know the general scope of
      the audience, but not their proficiency, take a moment to bring some of the
      newer audience members up to speed the base concepts that you'll build on later. You
      may present the same content at different events, but it should be made to fit
      the people in each room. (Also, yes you're allowed to present the same content
      multiple times! You don't have to create a new presentation for each talk. If
      you were at the lightning talks yesterday, this is the exact same slides as that! These
      slides have been adapted from an internal work presentation I have given to help
      people give presentations. Only the speaker notes have been changed.
  - alt: "Use \U0001F5BC."

Eearlier I had more visual aids in my opening, here I'm words, but I'm also giving a professional skills talk, rather than an engineering talk that might need code samples and such. Speaking of engineering..."
  - alt: Do the demo.
    image: images/slide_24.png
    text: Do the actual demo. If you have something to show that is. It's always
      a good idea to show, not tell. It's a good idea to have a backup recording,
      and making these can help you practice.
  - alt: Terse.
    image: images/slide_25.png
    text:
      If you're putting the words on the screen, adjust your text to use as few
      words as possible. People are going to read whatever you show on the slide.
  - alt: Use speaker notes.
    image: images/slide_26.png
    text:
      One thing that people won't be seeing when you present is your speaker notes. Notes
      are super helpful for you to remember what you wanted to say at the particular part
      of the presentation. You can do full transcripts*, or just bullet points, whatever
      will help you remember what you wanted to say. If you look up my slides
      later, there's a message hidden in the speaker notes on this slide :D
      

      <br><br><br><br>
      Hi! I am part of a full transcript! I tend to write out my script, even if I end
      up not utilising all of it on the day. It also helps for people using the slides
      afterwards as reference material!
  - alt: Practice.
    image: images/slide_27.png
    text: Practice your talk. You gotta practice. I know it sucks, but you gotta.
  - alt: Time it.
    image: images/slide_28.png
    text: You also need to time your talk. If you're speaking for 15 minutes and
      have 30 slides, is that one slide exactly every 30 seconds? or do you have
      some faster sections? You won't know til you've timed.
  - alt: "Practice.

      (again)"
    image: images/slide_29.png
    text:
      And then you gotta practice again. Practice helps you work out what works
      for you want what doesn't. It helps you make sure you don't have any accidental
      tongue twisters, that your flow works, and that you have at least tried the
      words out before you speak them.
  - alt: Pause.
    image: images/slide_30.png
    text:
      But you don't have to be speaking the entire time. Use pauses after important
      points to let them sink in. [light pause] This is difference between breathing
      and taking breaks between content. Did you know it's useful to continue to
      breathe throughout your presentation? it's true! I like to make sure I give
      myself drink breaks between major sections. [DRINK TEA] Speaking of section
      breaks...
  - alt: Things to avoid.
    image: images/slide_31.png
    text: Here's some specific things to avoid.
  - alt:
      "(far too many words, on purpose)"
    image: images/slide_32.png
    text: Avoid walls of text on a slide. Here's a perfect example.   See,
      you're not even listening to me, you're reading the text!
  - alt:
      "'too many words aaaa'"
    image: images/slide_33.png
    text: | 
    
      Walls of text like this are distracting, but they're going to be read faster by the audience than you could speak them. 
      If I could add a feature to all slide software, it'd be a little popup saying "Hi! It looks like you accidentally added your speaker notes to your slide deck. Let me help you move that off the slide."
       progressive bullet points to slowly add more things to the list.
      If you have a block of code you're going to walk though, have lines highlighted as you go. Draw attention to parts of the whole. 

      Earlier when I said use small amounts of text? This also helps you make sure the text you do have is legible. 

      The old adage would be: "Can you read this from the back of the room?" Now, it would be something like: "Can you read this over a 3G connection?"

      For reference, apart from this slide, no text in this deck is smaller than 20pt.

      If you have a demo, don't fake it. 

      It's really easy to spot a fake. And *if* your demo crashes, it proves you're really demoing it, and your audience will empathise with you. 

      One of the best talks I've ever seen had the demo go sideways after the speaker had already gone through hours of AV problems and was presenting on the *second* available borrowed laptop, but the live debugging with the audience, the interaction, made it all the better when the live coding worked. 

      I've even given a talk where my code sample intentionally works on my machine, but fails when I deploy it. It's a talk about debugging, where the narrative is around following the error messages, but it's still important to have practiced to know about the ways it *should* fail. 

      Again, this is all based on if it's possible to, based on your topic, show a demo. 


  - alt: ""
    image: images/slide_35.png
    text:
      "Don't use memes. They distract people from your content. Cat pictures only
      count if they're part of your demo. Another thing to avoid: memes. Don't
      put memes in your decks. This also goes back to the assumption thing. Memes
      make sense to people who know memes, but if people aren't up to date with
      the latest memes, or they don't get memes, or they don't get the underlying
      reference of the meme, then you have things on your slide that are going to
      be actively confusing your audience. Same goes with GIFs. Anything you have
      on the slide is going to draw attention, so what do you want your audience
      to focus on? You? Or the animation? Even if it's not a meme, having things
      like a cute cat in your deck may help 'brighten' the content, but won't
      provide any substance. Unless you want to go meta with the last point and have
      a cat picture as input in your demo, in which case, good work around!."

      based on prepared content. Some speakers invite raising of hands throughout,
      but they are also capable of handling that. If you want to make sure you can
      do your entire talk without having to suddenly break the flow, then just go
      do your talk. You don''t have to call it out specifically, but, if you do get
      a hand raised, a simple "I''ll answer questions later, thanks" should suffice. Depending
      on the event you''re speaking at, you may also get asked before you get on
      stage if you want to do a live Q&A. It''s okay to say no! It''s real skill to
      be able to reply to potentially complicated questions about your content that
      you didn''t cover. It''s very much thinking on your feet, but it''s also okay
      to say "I don''t know", and to follow up later. One thing I don''t miss
      from in person events are those people who try and think of trick questions,
      trying to prove they know more than the speaker. Or the people who go "I have
      a question, actually it''s more of a comment." Don''t be that person. As an
      attendee it''s good to, if the speaker wants to answer questions, have somethingready
      in case there''s no questions, but make it an easy one that can highlight their
      work.'

      Don't use TLAs. They can be extremely distracting when used without context.

      Oh, what are TLAs? Three Letter Acronyms. 

      They suck at the best of times. It's, again, harks back to audience assumptions. A Python audience *might* probably know what GIL means in context, but *won't* know acronyms from the specific project you're presenting on. 

      If you need to use acronyms, introduce term at the start of your presentation, and perhaps use the full term the first few times, then go to the acronym. Teach your audience something, starting with how to understand your acronym in a sentence.

      want to add, but it's better to make sure you don't change things last minute. *Some*

      the people who are engaged. If, say, on a video call, you notice someone doesn't
      seem to be paying attention, then there's probably a reason. They might be
      taking notes. They might be responding to something outside of view. They may
      have forgotten to go camera off. In an in person audience, that person on the phone
      might be trying to sort out something important, writing notes, or playing the latest
      mobile game. There's going to be people who aren't going to give you the energy

      Then, make your slides to match your script. Start with what you want to
      say, and the flow of the words in the presentation.

      (out loud.)"

    text:
      Read it, and read it out loud. To someone else if possible, but a plushie
      also counts. You really gotta practice. You have get those tongue-twisters
      out! You'll also start to get the cadence happening, work out what you like
      and what you don't like, and start to perform the content instead of just reciting
      it.
  - alt: 7. Time it.
    image: images/slide_53.png
    text:
      Time it! Use a stopwatch, either one on your phone, or the nice lil timer
      in Google Slides, or whatever. Try going through the talk at a normal pace.
      If you have a co-presenter, go through it together. I find that when I present
      a new talk, I will end up presenting faster than rehearsals because I tend
      to get nervous and start to speak faster. But that's okay, because if you finish
      early there's time for questions, or people can get to morning tea earlier! But
      the worst is having a talk run long. People in the room committed half an hour
      of time for you, and they have things to get to. If you start late, or have
      technical problems, then still try and finish on time.
  - alt: 8. Practice.

    text: And again, practice. <br><br><br><br>If you were telling a story at a party, you
      wouldn't need to practice, but you aren't also expected to make a polished
      half hour monologue at a party. With presentations you're giving focused technical
      content within a fixed time, with accompanying visuals. Practice to ensure
      you finish within the time allowed to respect your audience Practice the
      talk yourself, and if possible, for someone else. I've found success by recording
      by rehearsal, with the intention of someone else seeing it. I might send that
      recording on, I might not, but it helps me get into the zone.

      You're not Steve Jobs, and neither am I, so there's no "One More Thing." This
      is a call back to the time Steve Jobs finished an Apple Keynote, then in the encore
      **INTRODUCED THE IPHONE**. You might be tempted to copy this or other 'signature
      moves' by other popular auritors. They have hundreds of presentations under
      their belt, they have practiced and workshopped and have their style down. If
      you try and copy this, chances are you'll come across as 'lame'. You can give
      a good presentation without a gimmick, without prizes, just being you.

    text: Your audience wants you to succeed. They want to learn from you. They
      are your allies in this, and they're probably really happy that it's you and not them
      on stage right now. Just be you, and all else will follow. You got this.
