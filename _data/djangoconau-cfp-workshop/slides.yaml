  text: 'Outline: useful to show you''ve thought about this, but making it private
    means your<br>audience doesn''t see it and you''re not beholden to it. If you
    say you''ll have a 7 minute<br>demo and you go for 5, you won''t be yanked off
    stage.<br>---<br>Spoilers: it''s okay to entice people to your talk. You don''t
    have to have everything out<br>on display. It''s good not to bait and switch though,
    so make sure the reviews know<br>what you''re going to talk about.<br>For example,
    say you have a talk on testing. You''ll want to mention you''re using pytest<br>and
    whatever new extension package you''re exploring that makes tests, but you can<br>tell
    the reviewer something like "I''ll show the project used X on that took our tests
    from<br>30 minutes to 7 minutes (this number may improve before the conference!)<br>Also
    of note: you have to submit your talk this month. The conference is months<br>away.
    Active works in progress might change. Don''t write yourself into a corner, but<br>don''t
    use conference driven development <br>---<br>5: scope, problem,
