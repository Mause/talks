  text: Good afternoon, class.<br/><br/>This is Emoji Archaeology 101. We have a lot
    of material to get through, so let's get started.

  text: In 1963, the human emotion of happiness was created.<br/><br/>It was created by
    the American Harvey Ross Ball, who was employed to create an image of a happy
    face to raise the morale of the employees at an insurance company.<br/><br/>But once
    people realized that it was possible to express emotions, they wanted to express
    emotions of their own.

  text: "In a New York Times interview in April 1969, Vladimir Nabokov said:\"\
    I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile \u2013\
    \ some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket.\""

    0x2D

    0x29'

  text: In 1982 Scott Fahlman had a breakthrough, when he proposed the composition
    of three ASCII characters as a trigraph to express an emotion - happiness.
- alt: ':

    )'
  image: images/slide_4.png
  text: Although these code points don't, in themselves, represent any emotional context,
    if composed horizontally
- alt: :-)
  image: images/slide_5.png
  text: they combine to produce a powerful expression which the user can comprehend
    by simply turning ones head 90 degress to the left.
- alt: '0x3A :

    0x2D -

    0x29 )'
  image: images/slide_6.png
  text: While happiness does have significant utility as an emotion, users felt it
    was not meeting all their needs.
- alt: '0x3A :

    0x2D -

    0x28 ('
  image: images/slide_7.png
  text: However, by replacing the third codepoint
- alt: :-(
  image: images/slide_8.png
  text: the much more functional emotion of "unhappiness" could be expressed.<br/><br/>This,
    ironically, led to much higher levels of happiness, because users were now able
    to voice displeasure at everyone who disagreed with them.<br/><br/>Thus began a
    precambrian explosion in the expression of emotion, as users realized the
    hidden potential of the ASCII codepoint set.<br/><br/>The first changes were simple
    issues of ergonomics.
- alt: '(-:'
  image: images/slide_9.png
  text: By reversing the codepoint order, it was possible to evenly spread the physical
    exertion required to observe emotion.<br/><br/>More sophisticated extensions were
    then added
- alt: B-)
  image: images/slide_10.png
  text: such as adornment - wearing glasses
- alt: '%-)'
  image: images/slide_11.png
  text: or an optical tiredness from staring deep into the ASCII code chart looking
    for emotional inspiration.
- alt: :-D
  image: images/slide_12.png
  text: There was also a move to represent more extreme emotions - such as extreme
    happiness.
- alt: '>:-('
  image: images/slide_13.png
  text: Some expressions of extremis couldn't be embedded into three glyphs - they
    required the introduction of a fourth glyph, to demonstrate scorn,
- alt: :'-(
  image: images/slide_14.png
  text: or to embody a single tear, rolling down the face.
- alt: :'(
  image: images/slide_15.png
  text: Some purists felt that the three codepoint limit should be retained; and so
    they compressed complex emotions by losing the fidelity of nasal expression.
- alt: ' ~(_8^(I)'
  image: images/slide_16.png
  text: Others freed themselves of n-ary constraints, allowing for the rendition of,
    say, the absurdist philosopher Homer Simpson
- alt: " *<|:\u2011)"
  image: images/slide_17.png
  text: or beneficent midwinter courier, Santa Claus.
- alt: o_o
  image: images/slide_18.png
  text: Others revisited the premise that emotions had to be expressed horizontally,
    and looked to the perpendicular as a presentation style.
- alt: '@_@

    *_*

    (=_=)'
  image: images/slide_19.png
  text: However, the ASCII code set was reaching it's limit at this point.
- alt: "^\u03C9^"
  image: images/slide_20.png
  text: This led to the introduction of Unicode, providing vastly more alternatives
    with which to construct even deeper expressions of emotion.
- alt: "(\u25E0\u203F\u25E0*)\n\u30FD(`\u0414\xB4)\uFF89\n(\uFF61\u25D5 \u203F \u25D5\
    \uFF61)"
  image: images/slide_21.png
  text: It is not clear from the literature that *any* of these glyphs are actually
    used in their languages of origin.
- alt: "(\u30CE\xB0\u25A1\xB0)\u30CE\u5F61\u253B\u2501\u253B"
  image: images/slide_22.png
  text: The schism between minimalists and maximalists in the expression of emotion
    reached it's zenith in this pair of expressions:the 11 character "table
    flip" as an ultimate expression of anger, and
- alt: " \u30C4"
  image: images/slide_23.png
  text: this single character, as an expression of simple happiness.<br/><br/>Unfortunately,
    pressure was placed upon the Unicode consortium to allow more literal expressions
    of emotion.
- alt: "\u263B"
  image: images/slide_24.png
  text: This started with simple renditions, but over time,
- alt: null
  image: images/slide_25.png
  text: these expressions became more and more literal,
- alt: null
  image: images/slide_26.png
  text: removing all subtlety
- alt: null
  image: images/slide_27.png
  text: and nuance
- alt: null
  image: images/slide_28.png
  text: and indeed beauty, from the process of emotional expression...
- alt: null
  image: images/slide_29.png
  text: '... perhaps best demonstrated by the introduction of the "pile of poo" symbol,
    allowing scatological references without the need to understand what scatalogical
    actually means.'
- alt: Agency
  image: images/slide_30.png
  text: This has been accompanied by a loss of agency.<br/><br/>In the past, users could
    disruptively innovate and develop their own emotions.<br/><br/>But like some sort of
    Big Brother, only those emotions approved by the Unicode Consortium may be
    expressed.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if you like gophers - the Consortium, the savage
    arbiter of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, has determined that you shall not express
    that idea.<br/><br/>And no longer may we compose symbols to create rich new emotions.
    Only those compositions approved by The Consortium are permitted.
- alt: )
  image: images/slide_31.png
  text: The modern emoji represents a significant loss to our collective culture.
    The ability to embody happiness in the 8 bits of storage needed to display
    a right bracket - this... THIS is the essence of the human condition.<br/><br/>This
    is who we are. We are not stardust. We are not the champions. We are not a number.
    We are emotions, trapped in a brittle corporeal manifestation.
- alt: What to do?
  image: images/slide_32.png
  text: So what are we to do? Some might call for emoji to be eliminated. To be struck
    from our collective history.<br/><br/>But that would be defeat. We should fight
    for our emotions.
- alt: Rise up!
  image: images/slide_33.png
  text: So Rise up, my children!<br><br> Smash the control emoji!<br><br>Smash the control
    machine!<br><br>We have nothing to lose but our chains! <br><br>Don't be constrained by
    the limits placed on you by the Consortium. Compose new emotions, and express
    them - express them deeply, and longingly, and outwardly.
- alt: Class dismissed.
  image: images/slide_34.png
  text: And before someone asks -
- alt: 'This WILL be

    on the exam.'
  image: images/slide_35.png
  text: yes, this *will* be on the exam.
