# I like sleep.
Note: And I like sleep. No really, getting a good night sleep is the best. 
You know what's also really great?
waking up when my body is done, my batteries are at 100% charged, and I can get going with the best possible start to my day. 

I can get up, get my coffee and start my day. I can operate to the best of my ability. I can be providive and happy and get things done.

# I don't like tired. 

Note: but when I'm tired. Oh when I'm tired.. 

so when I get paged, especially at night, I'm tired. I'm not operating at my best. 

I'm not going to be 100% there, I'm not going to be as quick thinking. 

So what I need to do is to set myself up for to be the best I can be when, not if, when, the pager goes off at 3am.

! warning

Note: Because the 3am pager will probably happen. 

Sure, you can be lucky enough to be in a place with Follow the Sun (explain, possibly with maps?)

But you probably won't be, if you're on a small team. 

And even if you aren't, you're probably going to get something when you're not at your best, when you're sick or not with it or tired. 

So these tips and tricks can help you when you're not 100%, but also you can use the time you are 100% to feedback into this system.
