Before I start, a note about notes!

You don't have to take any.

I've got a lovely long list of all the links that I'll share at the end of the presentation.

I know this is the last talk of the conference, and our brains are almost full, and this talk might just overflow them;

but just put down your laptops and notepads, sitback, and relax.

We'll be covering a lot in this talk, but don't worry, I'll share the notes afterwards :)

One of my many roles in the Python community is as a Director of the Python Software Foundation.

The PSF is the organisation that holds the intellectual property rights behind the Python language.

We also run PyCon, recently held in Cleveland, and help other regional pycons around the world. We also help fund Python related development with our grants program.

A few weeks ago I put out a call on twitter asking what exicting projects have you seen that use Python.

Specifically, not Python itself, or infrastructure around python, but the application of python.

And the results were... biased.

I got a LOT of comments about new features in the python standard and cpython, about asyncio, dependency management and so much more.

Now, this is partially my fault; I have a lot of the people building the bits around python in my social spheres, so the group to which this question was asked was biased.

However

I wanted to know about the projects that help people in their daily lives.

About ways Python itself is a foundational element in the infrastructure in our technical society.

And I did get a few really good replies. Some of which will feature in this keynote.


Which brings me to the title of my talk --

Spreadsheets are extremely powerful and flexible.

They contain their own domain specific language where you can programatically affect your data input, it's has a great variety of visualistation properties in the forms of charts and graphs. Heck, it's technically turing complete -- meaning it can simulate a Turning machine, which describes the ability to be computationally universal. Meaning, you can create a computer **within** excel.

And people have.

I use spreadsheets all the time, even though I'm a Pythonista.

For example - Even though I have many purpose built systems for helping me put together the programme for PyCon Australia (it's in August in Sydney! Come along!) I still export data from these systems into a spreadsheet to be able to do complex analysis and calculated views on the data.

And spreadsheets are more popular that what you'd think.

Noting here that the font has been imported, but the math of the hand-drawn axes and lines is all dynamic.

The beauty of having these notebooks is that you can also pull the math out and share it around, much like Romer described earlier. I've used this math in my own graphing programs to comedic effect.

Data scientists, they aren't python packaing experts

Economists don't know pip from PEPs.

Trying to work out how to use pip and virtualenv and easy python and all that isn't interesting to them

It's an active barrier of entry.

Trying to tell a new or non programmer to just pip install something doens't make sense.

Having to dive down and explain that pip is a tool for installing packages, that they should be using virtualenv or pipenv, getting conflicting answers based on who they ask.

Trying to search for the answer themselves and finding easyinstall or other tools we know are now "deprecated", but the historical stackoverflow answers don't mention this, so blindly copying-and-pasting code ends up causing more confusion.

It's this sort of mindset that brought about

Anaconda wouldn't have had to be created if Python had a nice usable installation story.

this barrier will also be introduced to new Mac users this year, as the latest version of macos will not ship with python, ruby, or perl out of the box.

This means that you can't just run python without first installing it yourself.
Which can be a good thing. Those in linux land can attest to the fact that just because an operating system ships with *a* version of python doesn't mean it's a very recent version of python. Knowing how to install whatever version you need, and what is the version you need, is a very real barrier for the fledgeling programmer, regardless of the operating system.


And understanding that humans use Python on many operating systems is something we need to keep in our minds when we develop our applications.

These objects that were once fundamental to our use of computers are so outdated that these jokes can be made.

The IT teams in schools work so hard to provide a network that allows children to use computers. Heck, a lot of schools now are using tablets, not desktop computers.

There's just so much work to do to keep these systems up to date that deploying something like a local programming langauge sometimes isn't feasible.

Online systems like groklearning work around this by using the browser, but systems like mu need to be deployed somehow.

And installing System Python is just asking for trouble.

They call them script kiddies for a reason.

and without system python, there is no distribution story, let alone a deployment story.

In order for a developer to install something from PyPI, you need to pip install. Pip itself requires python. So without python, you can't install anything.

Thankfully there are solutions for this.

For windows environments, Mu uses pynsist, which allows Python itself to be bundled up with the application into one executable package, that sysadmins at schools can then deploy onto their fleet of machines.

By packaging python within the application, students can only interact with python from mu itself, thus removing the ability for a student to do any damage with the scripting language on the local network.

There is SO MUCH ART that's possible with python it's not funny; I could have filled the entire keynote with just this.


But here's the best of the best


Firstly, did you know that there's a charity auction every year specifically for pythonistas? It's true!

celebrating it's eighth year this year, the pyladies charity auction is a fundraising initiative that raises money for Pyladies, the international mentorship group to help more women become active participants of the python community.

Every year, items are donated, and on the night, folks dress up and have a wonderful evening bidding on some amazing items.

from beaded lanyards, laser-cut earrings, cross-stitches of helloworld and various interpretations of the python logo, all these pieces have been highly sought after.

IFTRUE: I'm wearing some of these right now (earrings, bracelet)

But it's not just art that looks like Python, there's also art that looks like Python *made* with Python.

I gave a talk in Cleveland and donated my demo.

One of these amazing projects was the octoknit project by Sarah Spencer

She hacked a domestic knitting machine from the 1980's to be a network printer, using a raspeberry pi and a program she wrote called octoknit, which uses a lot of python.

She can then print much like you would to a 3d printer, but instead of plastic, she uses yarn.

I had the fortune of seeing Stargazing in person at an event in Melbourne late last year, and it is art.

DeepDream, the computer vision API, inspired a bunch of artists that have created a range of beautiful pieces, like this one by Chris Rodley

Some of the deepdream images aren't as pretty as this one, so I'm using this one as an example of just how pretty you can make it.

But, the go-to example on the github repo for the project is, you guessed it, all written in python.

there are also services which use the same style, if you don't want to run the notebook yourself.

In this example, the image on the left was made by mixing the pycon thailand logo and a sample piece of artwork.

The results of inputting a source image and selecting a style are pretty amazing.


But a barrier here is how can creators share their work? how can they then allowfor others to remix and work from their creations?

simon describes that by using glitch, not only an others remix his work, but it's also an excellent way to setup a development environment that just works.

Even though the glitch documentation is all about nodejs and javascript, they do have very good python support

By altering the install value in the glitch.json file, you can pip install whatever package you need, and then change the start value to run what you want.

Now.

Doctor Bouman lead the development of the algorithm.

She wrote her doctoral thesis on this.

The entire project is fasinating. The team did a panel at GitHub Satelitte about the project, the video of which was just released a few days ago. I highly suggest you check it out.


When the blackhole image was released, there were 9 contributors to this repository. As of this screenshot, there are 14.

But it's so much more than just these people who contributed to this.

they could not have done the work that they did without the work from so many people.

???
at least 21 thousand people contributed code to dependencies of the code that helped see a black hole from the first time.

and a whole bunch of them are from Python.


And while that number is impressive, it's not even the whole of it.

What Github classes as contributors -- now "direct contributors" -- are only those who have code in the master branch.

These new "community contributors" are also those who have only committed to master on the respective dependencies.

Heck, Dr Bouman was absolutely riddaculed on social media because she didn't have the most amount of code in the project.

and technically, that's right. She doesn't.

But that doesn't mean anything.

She's the team lead. who has ever worked on a team where the lead has the most commits, the most lines of code in a project

since when does lines of code per developer matter?

since when does lines of code matter

Since when does code matter?

there are so many more people involved in a project than what github classifies as the "direct contributors"

Octohatrack shows not only the "direct contributors", but also anyone who has interacted with the repo at all.

Using octohatrack, I can see that even out of the 7 people from the team that were at Github Satelitte, while four of them are "direct contributors" according to github, I can see another contriburtor turns up in my results.

Two of those who were flown **to berlin to represent the project** don't classify as "direct contributions"; because as far as I can tell, neither have github accounts.

Projects are taking this into account with not just AUTHOR files, but CONTRIBUTORS files.

Just last week two important contributors to postgres, who have never committed code, were added to postgres' contributors file. Anastasia Lubennikova and Stacey Haysler have given countless contributions through their community work, and ensuring that work is thanked with the same enthusiasm as "technical" contributions is paramount, and to otherwise forget these people on the sidelines actively pushes them away from the project.

octohatrack specifically picks up listings in CONTRIBUTOR files that are formatted like email addresses and adds them to the list.
