Note: He gave an example of a user experience 

word count - copying into word itself, instead of using wordpress

so he fixed it

~@ woman_happy.jpg

Note: and that one bit of empathy

helped that one user

so much

**THINK ABOUT A TIME** you did the same. 

I'll tell you some of mine.

~@ office_169.jpg

Note: User wanted me to build them an app

Show part of a video, pause, then allow them to ask the group for an answer, then show the answer

that was just powerpoint. 

---

~@ presentation_169.jpg

Note: another one

a group giving a talk at a conference

expressing their frustrations at the limitations of a piece of software

after the talk, half a dozen people came up to tell them the answer.
