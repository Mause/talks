# Disentangle a new fangled image mangler

## Abstract 

For developers who live outside a command line interface, desktop backgrounds are one way that they can make their workspace more homely. Akin to artwork on the wall, and less permanent than a tattoo, they are a way of bringing a bit of life into a development environment.

However, given the rise of dual screens, laptops with secondary monitors, and mobile devices, there's never been a way to have one nice contiguous workspace background across all devices. Until now.

Gyprock is a Wallpaper as a Service, originally created from a completely manual process one developer used to solve this exact problem. Since then, it has been automated using a variety of staple Linux programs, and a few newer tools that can be utilized to solve a whole lot of problems beyond the desktop.

This presentation will take the audience on a guided tour through an experience of gluing together various bits and pieces to create a Rube^Hy Goldberg image manipulation service, from inception to completion.
