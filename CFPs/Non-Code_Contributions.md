# Build a Better Hat Rack: All Contributions Welcome


## Abstract
	
We have many ways of reporting and recognising our code contributions in open source projects, but often it is the work we do outside of code commits themselves that get forgotten and unattributed. Hours of code review, documentation, testing; organising of meetups and volunteering at conferences; even just brainstorming and talking about things â€” just how much of this is done without any kind of accreditation?

During this session, we will discuss what it means to contribute to open source projects, what constitutes a non-code contribution, steps we can take to recognise the work of our peers, and how projects can better encourage non-code participation through recognition and acknowledgement.
