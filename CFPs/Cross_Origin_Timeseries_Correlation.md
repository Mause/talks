# Before All Else, Be Graphed


## Abstract

When working with system metrics, you want to be able to compare different sets of time-series data in order to find patterns and correlations. It is often difficult to compare and contrast information across multiple different datastores.

This is the problem solved by Machiavelli, a web-based visualisation application. Given information about where data lives and how to access it, Machiavelli can show visualisations in a variety of formats, comparing one or more metrics across multiple different datastores, coalesced by time.

The presentation will cover the inspirations and use cases for Machiavelli, including a short demonstration of its use in production, and how it can be extended to show and correlate data from a new datastore.
