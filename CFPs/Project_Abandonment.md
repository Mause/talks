# Life After Death: How to handle abandoned projects


## Short
	
“We put countless hours into open source software development. When it all falls apart, how can we salvage what we've created? Let's discuss.”

## Abstract

Open Source software development is a very important part of the technology ecosystem. Some companies are taking this to heart by actively contributing developer time and resources in order to develop and open source internal projects. But people change employers, priorities and directions move, and systems die.

In this talk, we will discuss aspects of open source software development and the ownership of code, including licensing, copyright, project forking, and discussion about how to handle issues of developer departure and project abandonment.

## Keywords

 - personal story
 - licencing
 - code ownership
