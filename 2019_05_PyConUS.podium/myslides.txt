First ever lightning talk, for the "OtherSkills lightning talks"

(5 minute lightning talks, about stuff that's not computers)

There were talks about: bread, choirs, and me, about cross-stitching 

---

~@ green_display.jpg

Note: I was talking about this cross-stitch I made

---

~@ pokebros.gif

Note: the original artwork was created by a pixel artist from Melbourne, Paul Robertson. He's known for his work on things like the Scott Pilgrim vs the World game, Mercenary Kings, and the videoclip for Architecture in Helsinki's Do the Whirlwind. 

---
~@ pokebros_green.gif

Note: Pixel art, especially those with distinct colour palettes, map really well to cross-stitching

Each  pixel maps to one stitch. 
---

~@ green_design_clip.png
Note: so you can import your design into one of the many closed-source, Windows only programs, and generate a chart for you to reference. 

Each cell has a colour and a symbol which maps to a specific thread colour. 

---

~@ green_working.jpg

Note: you then take that design, that chart, that graph, whatever you wish to call it, and one by one fill in the pattern onto your fabric, or canvas. 

---

~@ green_lynn.jpg

Note: Years after my original lightning talk, This particular design, well, all three of them, were auctioned off atht the PyLadies fundraising auction in 2017

As shown here by the wonderful Lynn Root.  

---

# &nbsp;

Note: now, as part of this lightning talk I gave, I mentioned that the program I used to take the source image and turn it into the chart in which to use as a reference for the stitching was made using a closed source, Windows-only program. 

And I said: 

---
# &nbsp; 

*"If you know anything about image manipulation, colour setting, cross stitch charts...*
--

*If there is any [FOSS] software out there please tell me.*


--

*Otherwise I will make my own,*

--
*and present it here next year"*

Note: it was my first ever lightning talk, and I made a promise. Yes, it's a bit late, but you know, a year was just an estimate.

# <BR><BR> Problems to solve

Note: so, by my own unscripted ramblings 5 years ago, I set myself three problems to solve
--

### "image manipulation"

--

### "colour setting"

--

### "cross stitch charts"

---

##= Image manipulation

Note: first step, image manipulation. 

If I'm provided an image, I want to be able to go through every pixel in the image, and work out the colour

And we can do that in Python with
---
#= `pillow`
### Python Imaging Library
---
##= `getpixel((x,y))`
---

@ getpixel/large_3x3-2.png
### 3x3.png
Note: If I have a 3x3 image, with 9 pixels, all different colours, we can use this as a solid testing platform for testing getpixel

---

@ getpixel/large_3x3-4.png
### 3x3.png

Note: the co-ordinate system in Pillow starts in the top left, and works it's way across and down
---
$$# PIL.getpixel()
.right-image[![img](images/getpixel/large_3x3-4.png)]
<BR>
py- >>> from PIL import Image
py- >>> im = Image.open("3x3.png")
py- >>>  im.getpixel((0,2))
py- (255, 0, 0, 255)
sh- #  R .white[.] G.white[.] B .white[.] A
sh <br># (0,2) == red .white[ . . . . . . ] -->

Note: 

So we can address a single pixel in an image. 

From here, we can loop through, and get the RGB values for every pixel in the image. 

This will be useful later on. 

But, onto the next problem
---
#= Colour setting 

Note: colour setting. Yes, colour with a "U"

But first. 
---
##= Let's learn about floss
---
@= dmc-logo.jpg

Note: Dollfus-Mieg et Compagnie

Is an Alsatian textile company, founded in 1746

Not to be confused with the hiphop group. 

When I talk about DMC, I mean 
---
~@ dmc-rack.jpg
Note: this stuff. 

If you're Australian, you'll find a setup like this in your local Spotlight or Lincraft. In America, think Michaels, or Hobby Lobby
---
~@ floss_macro.jpg

Note: this is the DMC Floss, floss like the stuff you use to get food out from between yur teeth. 

DMC have hundreds of different colours, all referenced by a code, in this multitrand medium. 

Most pre-made cross-stitch charts and software will refer to DMC as the floss only

However, they sell more than Floss
---
~@ wool_macro.jpg
Note: they also sell wool. DMC Tapestry Wool is a thicker medium, and while I've been using the word "cross-stitch" so far, technically you can't really use it for Cross-stitch. 

The physical medium of these thread is interesting. 
---

#= ⊠⊠⊠
### Cross Stitch
# ⧄⧄⧄
### Half Stitch

Note: if you have a very tight canvas; in cross-stitch you'll have say an Aida 14ct Cloth, to fill a square you would use, say, three ply of the floss in a cross-pattern. Complete this around your canvas, and you fill in all the gaps  and create a complete image. 

With the wool, however, it's too thick to use 14ct. I personally work in 10ct canvas, and with this medium I can only use half-sttich. A single half-stitch fills the square, so it works at scale. 

---

~@ wool_macro.jpg

Note: but this is where the fun comes in. 

You see, floss and wool are not cross-compatible. They don't share codes, and they don't share palettes. 

And, as I said, a lot of charts only refer to the floss. So, we need to convert from floss to wool.

The colours you're seeing now are part of the set called 'Cranberry'
---

@ dmc-cranberry.png
Note: while the names aren't strictly official, the codes are important. 

There is a cross-compatibility chart, which is somewhat official as it has a terribly pjeg artefacted DMC logo, but it states that it's supposed to be used as a guide only. However, it does give us an aproximation of how to compare skeins of different medium (a skein being one 'spool')

The 'floss' from before has 600-series numbers for cranberry. And with this DF, you can see that the tapestry wool equivelent has a 7600 series

But they don't exactly match. 
---
## The Cranberries - Analyze
.right-image[![pic](images/wool_6floss_crop.jpg)]
<pre><code style="font-size: 36px; line-height: 1.5;">

V DK Cranberry&nbsp;&nbsp;600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7600
DK Cranberry&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;601
MD Cranberry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;602&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7603
Cranberry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;603&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7604
LT Cranberry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;604&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7605
V LT Cranberry&nbsp;&nbsp;605
</code></pre>

Note: if we go through the chart, we can see that there are many more floss threads available than wool. 

For the Cranberry series, there are 6 available floss threads, but only four wool. And in this picture, my local craft-store was even completely out of one of the wool skeins. 

This out of stock issue will come up later. 

As a matter of numbers, there's on average about a 3 to 2 ratio of floss to wool mappings. 

---

## <br><BR><br> Floss → Wool ✓*
Note: so, we can, mostly, convert a floss thread to it's wool equiv. That's great. 

But we're working with computers. Pillow can get us RGB values 
--

## DMC → RGB ??

Note: so how can we 

---
#= No official mapping exists
### 'proprietary information'
.footnotes[[thread-bare.com](https://www.thread-bare.com/2017/09/20/creating-cross-stitch-charts-with-consistent-colors)]
Note: Officially there's no official mapping. 

It's 'proprietary information', colours can drift over time

Indeed, it's recommended that you buy your threads from the same dyelot to ensure they are from the same manufactured batch. 

This mades sense. This is a company trade secret, from the 1800's. 

It could allow competitors to "steal" and cheaply reproduce the colours.
---

##= however

Note: however. There are ways around this. 

You can find, with a lot of searching, someone's unofficial mapping of colours. I've used it before. 

However. 

You could always create your own. 
---

##= however

Note: 
You could go through every available thread, take a picture of the thread, work out the best colour, and go from there. 

Now, you'll have to deal with a bunch of variables

lighting, the camera being used, the environment the picture was taken. 

If these are consistent throughout the entire photoshoot, you can get a pretty good average colour. 

And even then, you should always use these sort of things as a guide only. 

The threads will change per dye lot, the colurs you have in your design may not look the nicest together. 

But it gets a lot of the job done. 

Lucky for me, since I first started looking into this problem space, DMC has updated their website. 

---

~@ dmc_floss_pink.png

Note: They have all the colours available for their threads with their codes on their website. 

We can see here, the 600 thread from the cranberry series. Except for a few things -- 

It doesn't use the names any more. 

The actual skein doesn't list any color, only the code; the color name is helpful, but is not a primary identifier. 

The other thing?

---

~@ dmc_wool_pink.png

Note: the equivelent colour in wool doesn't exist any more. 

Indeed, in the old mapping I found, there was about 450 floss threads, and just under 300 wool threads. 

According to their website now, 
---

@ dmc_floss_count.png
@ dmc_wool_count.png

Note: there's 489 floss threads, and only 100 tapestry wool threads left. 

That's not a lot.  We'll touch on this later; as both these numbers cause us issues. 

---

~@ dmc_wool_pink.png

Note: back to this page. 

we can see that they've captured both swatches and the full skein for each thread. 

From here, we can download these images, and use them to work out the average colour. 

How?

---

##= `getpixel((x,y))`
---

$$# PIL.getpixel()
.right-image[![img](images/486_e_7202_150x150.jpg)]
<BR>
py- >>> from PIL import Image
py >>> im = Image.open("486_e_7202_150x150.jpg")

Note: we can import our image like before

and then... 

--
py >>> count, r, g, b = [0,0,0,0]
py >>> for x in range(0, im.width):
py >>> &nbsp; &nbsp; for y in range(0, im.height):
py >>> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i, j, k = im.getpixel((x, y))
--
py >>> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; r += i; g += j; b += k;
py >>> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; count += 1
--
py- >>> print int(r/count), int(g/count), int(b/count)
py (210, 138, 149)

---

##= <span style="color: rgb(210, 138, 149); background-color: rgb(210, 138, 149); padding: 50px">....</span>
@ 486_e_7202_150x150.jpg

Note: I mean, I guess this is pretty close?

But if we repeat this cross all the images we have access to, we can at least process them all in the same way. 


We can then get a list of color codes, and their aproxx rgb colors. 

This is useful for later. 

SO

the third issue.

##= Reducing picture to only available colours

Note: We have up to 489 colours.  We only have a certain number of colours we can physically use, save for dying our own, but that's a problem for another medium.
