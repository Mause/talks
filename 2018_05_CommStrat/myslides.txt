Note: dragons

Dragons and dragon mythology stretch across the world in different mediums, from creation tales to table top games

But what I'm talking about is one specific dragon

!  e/1 | e/Fcap | e/4 | e/0 | e/9

Note: Dragon one eff four oh nine

This is the code point for the dragon emoji

I can't send you this dragon, sadly. 

But I can send you the reference code point to this dragon, and your phone, tablet, laptop will intepret that codepoint, and display *a* dragon

But it might not be this dragon

It depends on what operating system your device is using

Note: if you have a HTC phone, your dragon will look like this

But if oyu have a samsung, it'll look like

---
= <img height='400px' src='pictures/dragon/samsung9.png'>

Note: like this

But that's only if you have the latest updates on your phone

If you don't
---

= <img height='400px' src='pictures/dragon/samsung7.png'>

Note: your dragon looks a little bit cuter!

The thing is, HTC and Samsung have their own emoji

If oyu have an android phone by a different manufacturer

---

= <img height='400px' src='pictures/dragon/android4.svg'>

Note: your dragonw ill probably look like this

But if you have a newer android, or have service from a provider that gives operating system updates

---

= <img height='400px' src='pictures/dragon/android8.png'>

Note: your dragon will look like this

But if you have an iphone, your dragon will look completely different


---

= <img height='400px' src='pictures/dragon/apple6.png'>

Note: older apples will look like this

and newer ones

---

= <img height='400px' src='pictures/dragon/apple.png'>

Note: will look like this

But it doesn't matter what platform you have if you're using certain social media platforms

Because they have their own emoji!

---


= <img height='400px' src='pictures/dragon/twitter.svg'>

Note: twitter's version looks more like the Loch Ness Monster

And for Facebook, it's even worse, because it can depending HOW YOU"RE USING FACEBOOK

= <img height='400px' src='pictures/dragon/messenger.png'>

Note: if you're using the Facebook Mobile app, messenger, your dragon looks like this

but if you're using the facebook WEBSITE

---
= <img height='400px' src='pictures/dragon/facebook.png'>

Note: your dragon looks different **AGAIN**
---

! dragon/htc.png | dragon/samsung7.png | dragon/samsung9.png | dragon/android4 | dragon/android8.png 
! dragon/apple6.png | dragon/apple.png | dragon/twitter | dragon/messenger.png | dragon/facebook.png

Note: There are ten different dragons here, and that's not even counting if you have an older version of windows, if you're running linux, if you have custom emoji sets...

And here's the thing. They all look like dragons. I mean, sure, some look more european, and others look more like traditional Long dragons, but they're all dragons. 

And depending on if you're using facebook on the web or messenger your dragon will change between chinese and medieval... but they're all dragons. 

I mean, sure, a few of them are charging up ball lightning for some reason, but they're all dragons

It's when you start trying to use only emoji to communicate that you get issues. 

For example, if you were to send the message: I feel powerful, but you drop powerful and just send a dragon...
