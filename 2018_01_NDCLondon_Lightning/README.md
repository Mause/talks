## Technical Explanations

### JavaScript

Type coersion, inherited behaviour from Java

Numbers can be cast into Strings in some situations

### Ruby

Order of prescidence. "&&" and "and" are separated by "not"

### Haskell

Haskell is extremely expressive functionally, which allows for wonderful gems like the three-line Fibonacci sequence

```haskell
fibSlow :: Int -> Int
fibSlow 0 = 0
fibSlow 1 = 1
fibSlow n = fibSlow (n - 1) + fibSlow (n - 2)
```

### Pascal

The assignment operator for many programming languages is a single equals sign. Pascal differs from the norm by using `:=` instead. Given this, programmers unfamiliar with this separation from the 'standard' are tripped up.

### Bash

Math in bash is doable, but the general solution to bash errors to just "wrap brackets around it" prevails here.
