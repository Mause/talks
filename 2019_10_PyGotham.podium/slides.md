for the last 8 years, on and off, I've worked as a

systems administrator

automation engineer

operations engineer

site reliabiltiy engineer

For a bunch of different places, including web hosting providers.

It was my job to make sure not only did your website stay up, but also

if you paid enough money

I'd get woken up in the middle of the night if your website was down.

Given that context.

A bit about how django works

Some of the current hosting options that are available

And how you get your website off your laptop and onto one of these hosting providers.

in other words, what, where and how

Which if you open up your web browser

you can see your django site.

And that works fine for you.

the problem is that the djangogirl next to you

she won't be able to see your website

This is because your website is running just on your laptop.

So what we need to do is Deploy it.

so I can just take a copy of what I have on my machine, and put it on the cloud, right?

Well, no.

There is one major issue.

the django documentation clearly describes that you should not

---

class: middle, center, image
![Image](images/runserver_01.png)

???

use this in a production setting.

It has not gone through security audits or performance tests.

And there's even a super helpful note.

And that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs gonna stay. We‚Äôre in the business of making Web frameworks, not Web servers, so improving this server to be able to handle a production environment is outside the scope of Django.

Which is a very important distinction.

emphasis on framework.

what we need, is a web server.



---

![Image](images/webserver_logos_old.png)

there are a few major web servers that you may have heard mention of.

Apache, Nginx, or IIS (internet information server)
---

![Image](images/webserver_logos_new.png)
.fix-tilt-long[.w[....]and&nbsp;more!]
???

they've all got new logos now, so maybe one of these versions is more familiar to you.

There's also Caddy now that's picking up steam

All these web servers talk HTTP

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

as in

that HTTP

The http you type into your browser.

---

but these web servers have a problem.

---

class: title
# .e[üêç‚ùå]

they don't talk python. Not directly.

You need an interface that can talk to python and to a web server

---

that's where w.s.g.i comes in. Or, "whis-gee".

---

### `PEP-0333`, `PEP-3333`

???

there are PEPs - Python Enhancement proposals - which define

If your web framework (django) can talk WSGI, then you can use any wsgi server you like.

And thankfully, django supports wsgi

if you check your python project

you'll see that you'll have

a convenient wsgi.py file.

<div class="shell-wrap"><p class="shell-top-bar">bash</p><p class="shell-body">
<ps>myrtle</ps> <dr>~/my_project $</dr>

<ps>myrtle</ps> <dr>~/my_project $</dr>
cat wsgi.py<w>&nbsp;</w>

???

which was automatically generated when you created your django project.

It'll contain

<div class="shell-wrap"><p class="shell-top-bar">bash</p><p class="shell-body">
<ps>myrtle</ps> <dr>~/my_project $</dr>
ls my_project/<br>

<ps>myrtle</ps> <dr>~/my_project $</dr>
<w>&nbsp;</w>

???

some template code that exposes the wsgi callable as a module-level variable named application.

This will be important later.

So we know django talks wsgi, so we can use one of the many wsgi servers


---

there's ones like micro-wsgi or gunicorn.

These are super interesting in themselves, and there's a great many talks on them

so we have this whole mess of logos.

It's complicated.

So how do we actually deploy thing?

Infrastrucutre. The where.

Because if you choose the right kind of setup, you can ignore most of those logos.

I know.

# TODO

used to be physical servers
one per person
ale. <pre><code class="scala"></code></pre>
you'd have to worry about everything.

then virtual servers (iaas)
several per machine
you'd still have to worry about things, but not hardware


then platforms (paas)
heroku, pythonanywhere, divio
sepcific to a language

and now containers
as containers are now standardised


---

class: title
# .e[üöö]

???

chapter three

Deployment. The how.


---

class: title
# TODO

depends on which platform you selected

sometimes it's a manual copy and paste

services like python anywhere pull from yourt github

source control is a good idea

others can push from your github. webhooks!

but

there's your code
youer database
and your assets
