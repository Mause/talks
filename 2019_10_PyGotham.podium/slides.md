Hi! I'm katie, and this isn't the talk you're expecting.

---

class: title
## .thin[What this talk isn't.]

???
this isn't a talk about "the one true way" to deploy your app

This talk doesn't give specific answers, mostly, but describes the ecosystem

This talk is diving into the complexities of deployment, in essense

---


class: title
# .thin[What .b[is] deployment,<br>anyway?]

???
We'll discuss, well ,what is deployment, anyway?

---
class: title
# .thin[What is .prokyon[django] deployment,<br>anyway?]
???

and specifically within the context of deploying a django application.

But I'm choosing django here for a reason, which will become apparaent later.
---
class: title
# Points of interest
## out of the box .prokyon[django]
## complexities
## helpers

???

we'll be taking a journey today, so instead of an agenda, here are at least a few points of interest along our trip.

We'll start by looking at exactly what comes out of the box with django

and from there discuss the complexities django has compared to other frameworks when it comes to deployment

not the complications, just the complexities.

and discuss the helpers django has to assist you.

---
class: title
# .prokyon[django] 2.2.5
# .flux[python] 3.7.4

???

the versions I'm targetting today are specifically django 2.2.5 and python 3.7.4

If you're joining me on YouTube from the year 2027, I'm sorry, things have changed since, but hopefully you find value in this talk!

---
class: title
## no extra addons

???

we're also just going to stick to base django

No additional features, no task management, no other helpers

Just whatever comes in stock standard django

This talk should be useful if you're anywhere from looking at django

to having your djangogirls tutorial project working on your laptop

to a more complex setup, but no extra complexities.

---

class: title
## Let's look at .prokyon[django]

???

so let's get started, by taking a look at django as it comes out of the box

### - .prokyon[django] documentation

I want to pull this out and elaborate.

Django is an extremely stable, production ready, web framework.

Django is very good at being a web framework.

The fact that it provides any local web server functionality at all is amazing, but the fact that it calls out that it's not for production is also very very good.

We'll discuss a selection of webservers you should use in production a bit later.

development environment.

class: title
# .prokyon[django]
## ease of use in development
???

django a really good development story

but all the helpers we used in development cannot and should not be used
in production.

so we can't use any of these helpers
---

class: title
# .prokyon[django]
## complex in production

???

which makes our production use.. complex.

django doesn't provide you with a webserver or database that's production ready

So you have to provide your own.

We'll get into some of the options in a moment.

But first I want to mention something important

---
<br><BR><BR>
# .poly[Flask]
## simpler in production<br>.h3[(comparatively)]
???
Compare the out of the box functionality of django to something like flask

A lot of tutorials you see out there use flask as the target of a python web server deployment demonstration

This is because of one simple fact
---
class: title
# .b[state]

???

django is a stateful application. It has a database out of the box and static assets.

Flask by default does not. It can, but out of the box, it doesn't

---

class: title
# stateful applications
## complex in production

???

any application that has state is complex in production.

This is why I chose to use django for my context

If I'd chosen flask, the discussion of deployment could be **really easy**

buyt it's not just django; any time you care about persistence you add complexity to your deployments.

And, funnily enough, this is also mentioned in the docs

---
class: middle, center, image
![Image](images/deployment_00.png)
.footnotes[[âžš](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/static-files/deployment/#serving-static-files-in-production)]

every production setup will be a bit different.

# .quote["Every production setup<br>will be a bit different"]
### - .prokyon[django] documentation
???
I'm not sure who added this line to the documentation

which has been in the docs for a decade at this point

but whoever it was was such a smart cookie.

This is so so important.

So important it's on it's own slide.

But this statement is so so true.

---


class: title
# .quote["It depends."]
### - every deployment talk ever

???

Nearly every talk I've seen on deployment includes a line likee

it depends

When trying to tell you the "one true way" to do django deployments.

Because it's true.

But I'm not going to use that line. I'm going to use another one.

---

class: title
# .quote["I'm an operations engineer. I'm not your operations engineer."]
### - @glasnt

???

I prefer this line.

I'm an operations engineer, I'm not your operations engineer.

I've been a sysadmin, operations engineer, SRE, whatever you want to call it

on and off for nearly the last decade.

I've worked for

... web hosting providers

... platforms as a service

and now

infrastructure as a service.

And each and every deployment is different and unqiue and beautiful and complex.

---
<br><br>
# to deploy a stateful app:
???

and for any stateful application, you have at the bare minimum three major segments
---
<br><br>
# to deploy a stateful app:
## run web framework
???

you need a way to run the web framework, whatever it is

---
<br><br>
# to deploy a stateful app:
## run web framework<br>connect to a database
???

a way to connect to your database
---
<br><br>
# to deploy a stateful app:
## run web framework<br>connect to a database<br>serve static files
???

and a way to serve whatever static apps you have.

this exact trifecta is the same for Django.

you need to run the web framework, connect to a database, and serve the static.

These are the same requirements are for any stateful application

Therefore, we can explore what a stateful application deployment means without
having to keep outselves within django itself

But, thankfully for us using django, we have some helpers.

how much custom infrastrcutre do you want?

Because as we saw before, every production setup is a bit different

80% of cases

and if you only have a standard django app, then these are going to work for you.

## How much<br>infrastructure management<br>do you want<br>to do yourself?

how much infrastrcutre management do you want to do yourself?

If you are a django developer, then you probably want to develop django

you don't want to be spending your time trying to manage your infrastrcture

it's super interesting, sure, but when you want is just to get your application online, then why not pay someone who has spent the time to setup a way that works for 80% of websites

In our setup, we don't have anything custom, so why not let someone else manage tings for you?

put in more simpler terms

in the managed hosting world, for the complexity of project we're talking about, there are two major options

PaaS and IaaS
---

class: title
# Managed hosting:
## PaaS
## IaaS
.footnotes[* non-exhaustive]

???

you'll often seen these abbreviated as Paas or IaaS, because words are getting long and we're busy technologists.

And yes, this is non-exhaustive. Within the scope of deploying a django application, these are the two major options.

You could go as detailed as running your app on a server you have in your own home or business ("on-prem"), or trying to squeeze django into a function as a service, but these are the 20% of cases.

I'm going to focus on the ones that are much more suited for django

---
<BR><BR>
# Platform as a Service
### worry about:<br>your .prokyon[django] app, data

.footnotes[Example providers: Heroku, Divio, Google Cloud, PythonAnywhere]

???

in general your platforms as service are going to be places where you provide your code to them, often fit to some sort of template, which normally includes the command to run to get your app working. This will often be uwsgi or guniconr

---
<br><BR>
# Platform as a Service
### managed for you: <br>web server, operating system,<br>hardware, storage, networking...
.footnotes[Example providers: Heroku, Divio, Google Cloud, PythonAnywhere]

???

the things that will be managed for you include the web server (often included in whatever template you have), the operating system, the physical hardware, the storage, networking, and a whole host of other things.

On the otherhand, if you have opinions about some of the earlier elements in this, you can jump down into

<BR><BR>

IaaS. Where you can worry about your web server and operating system.

---
<BR><BR>
# Infrastructure as a Service
### managed for you: <br>hardware, storage, networking...
.footnotes[Example providers: Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Azure]

and you pay for someone else to manage the hardware, storage, etc.

Now this is very very much an overgeneralisation, as there is an entire other talk on the complexities of infrastrcutre as a service.

but there is a reason I mentioned this

These are the migrations we generated earlier

these create the data strcutures required for the the django admin to work

you can see it in the filenames - admin, auth (authentication), sessions.

But to migrate data, you need a database.

and here's the secret.
---
class: title
## Managed databases<br>are just a specialised<br>aaS

managed databases are just specalised "as a service"

whatever bucket you want to put them in depends on your definition, if they IaaS or Paas or even Software as a service, but either way, they're a service.

making the migrations and applying them to whatever database you choose is django's problem. More on that a bit later.
---
<br><BR>
## Managed databases
### managed for you:<br>storage, backups, persistence, maintenance...

.footnotes[Example providers: your PaaS or IaaS provider]

???

your database host will often handle everyhitng from backups to storage (including scaling storage, which is often very good.

These will often be available from your web server provider, which is often a very good idea because the closer your web server and database the faster you can send data between the two parts of your application.

TODO

more here something along the lines of

there is no reason not to use a managed database any more

managed databases are a solved problem, pay for one and get the benefits

a lot of people use databases, so a lot of work has gone into them

pay just a little bit and you often get:

- persistence
- backups
- maintenance windows
- more so: you don't have to manage it.

heck, some now days even automatically expand and the providers handle this without downtime for you

this and your domain name might be the only thing you end up paying for in a smaller stack, but it's worth it.

# asset management options:

## simple assets
## cloud storage
## media uploads
## asset compilation
.footnotes[["Assets in Django without losing your hair" by Jacob Kaplan-Moss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E613X3RBegI)]


???

he details four scenarios,

simple assets

cloud storage

media uploads

and the more complex asset compilation ption

if you chose a chose a IaaS provider earlier, they probably offer some sort of cloud storage, which is super useful to have, again, to keep everything physically close.

If you went with the PaaS, perhaps the simple asset solution is for you.

TODO

more here, something long the lines of:

out of all the tech I've discussed so far, cloud storage is the oldest and most solid

AWS literally launched S3 in 20XX. That's YY years ago.

storing media objects is a foundational service provided by any cloud provider.
and it's totally okay to use

the scariest thing when I first came across s3 was the fact that I had to use a global bucket name. Like, a name that had never been used before
but that's okay

the way this works means that the name must be unique for every reference

use this foundational service of the current internet age

and make sure that when you name your bucket it's not just your app's name or your internet name because once you use that name it's gone forever and you'll probably want to change your naming scheme at once point so if it's your first one just make sure it's not a super cool name.
