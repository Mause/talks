Note: 

I also had so many people joking about "Why not have a Dave Conf or a Steve Conf"

Sure, just go to any other conference.

I've been the only female speaker at a conference. 

I've attended conferences with zero female speakers, where a female speaker was shoe-horned in at the last minute to improve their image. 

That's not the point

Carina C Zona:

People of different genders have very different life experiences, career experiences, perspectives on what they do. Greater range of topics and framing is more valuable for everybody.


* PyCon AU 25% ish
* Pycon US 2016 40% Female
* DjangoCon US 40% Female
* DjangoCon Europe: 52% Female

This is awesome. I just wish more conferences did this.
