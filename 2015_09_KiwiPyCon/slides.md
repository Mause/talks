## All Contributions Welcome

 <img src="pictures/footer.svg" />

Note: These are my speaker notes.

There are many like them, but these ones are mine

---

# Hi! <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: Hi! I'm Katie, and I'm a software developer.

I wear many hats. I use all the languages.

Just in the last year I've used Ruby, Perl, JavaScript, Haskell, and Python in production

---

 <img src="pictures/openstack_docker.png" />

Note: I do OSS contributions

Docker have paid me for my contributions

I am also an Active Technical Contributor for Open Stack

Want to know what my contribution to OpenStack was?

---

# ATC in -6+3 characters <!-- .element: style="margin-bottom: 1em" -->

 <img src="pictures/OpenStackDiff.png" />

Note: an inline documentation change. It's a Python file, yo

---

 <img src="pictures/SummitToyko.png" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: Commit to Liberty, go to Tokyo

Incentive :D

There are many reasons to help with the bigger projects

---

 <img src="pictures/question.svg" />

Note: But how do we track all these contributions that we make

---

 <img src="pictures/github.svg" />

Note: GitHub gives us some of this functionality

Pretty graphs and the like

---

 <img src="pictures/github-a.svg" />

Note: but it's not exactly perfect

And it only include itself

---

 <img src="pictures/OtherSources.svg" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: For OpenStack, there's context specific tools

There are tools that have come out of the GitHub data hack days.

---

 <img src="pictures/question.svg" />

Note: But what about everything else?

Code Review

Documentation 

Testing 

Design 

UAT 

Promotion 

User Groups / Presentations

---

 <img src="pictures/straw_poll.png" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: Who here has:

used a community developed python framework?

taught that to their colleges?

volunteered at an event

spoken at a meetup?

spoken at a conference?

attendened a conference? (ALL HANDS)

---

<img src="pictures/youre-awesome.gif" style="width: 250%; margin-top: -50px">

Note: These are all contributions

Not even including all the aspects of the SDLC that go unattributed

Community, yo

---

 <img src="pictures/help.svg" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: So, how can we track and record and acknowledge all this?

---

 <img src="pictures/leslie.png" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: Let me tell you about Leslie

Amazing human being


---

# #LABHR <!-- .slide: class="center" -->
## bit.do/LABHR

Note: She started this hashtag, and wrote a blog post about it

---

 <img src="pictures/ikea_manual.jpg" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: Which I've turned into a easy to read manual to try and spread the message

---

# DÅLIGORDLEK <!-- .element: style="margin-bottom: 1em" -->

---

 <img src="pictures/meeting.svg" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: Leslie and Deb meet over coffee

Leslie of Google / Elastic

Deb of Open Innovation Network

Sahana Software Foundation

“No, this is great. This gives me one of those places to hang your hat.

You know, something you can list on your LinkedIn profile instead of just a project that you work on for free because you love it.

But no one really knows about it or notices.”



---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_0.svg" />

Note: So Leslie + Blog = 5 steps

---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_1.svg" />

Note: write the list

---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_2.svg" />

Note: send the list

---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_3.svg" />

Note: GRAVY

Tweet about it

---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_4.svg" />

Note: GRAVY #2

Linked in Recommendations

NOT endorsements

See later


---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_L.svg" />


Note: GRAVY #3

Do it for someone not like you

---

 <img src="pictures/yay.svg" />

Note: Simple! Nice! Helpful!

---

 <img src="pictures/halp.svg" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: But it didn't get that much traction

Leslie reported ~30 known LinkedIn recommendation

I've done talks for: Python, PHP, Ops

I've done talks in multiple different cities

It's always the same, one or two after the talk

(PyConAU exception - because I refused to get off stage until 10 tweets happened)
(This did result in some residiual activity during the sprints)


Maybe y'all need a LIVE DEMO

THIS DIDNT HAPPEN LAST TIME

---

 <img src="pictures/tweet_1.png" />

Note: Chris was a little bit upset last time this happened

---

 <img src="pictures/ChrisMore.png" />

Note: But he does tend to help me but with these talks a lot

Back to PyCon


---

 <img src="pictures/tweet_2.png" />

Note: And not just him.

---

 <img src="pictures/tweet_3.png" />

Note: It took a third party to actually confirm they did good.

I've seen this before, not only in the #LABHR

# Why can't we take a compliment? <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

# Minimisation <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

---

# Tall Poppy Syndrome <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: We are reluctant to allow ourselves to be elevated in front of our peers, lest we be cut down.

And of course, everyone's favourite

---

# Imposter Syndrome <!-- .slide: class="center" -->


Note: If we get thanked, we tend not to think it actually applies, because all the problems

---

# Acknowledging our *own* achievements <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: one way to break this is to start to acknowledge our own achievements

---

 <img src="pictures/donut.jpg" />

Note: Lara Hogan, Donut Manifesto

This donut = draft of a book

Giving ourselves a little celebration if noone else will

Tweeting the donut

Piggybacking on a picture of a donut (instagram makes this OK).


---

 <img src="pictures/MyDonut.jpg" />

Note: I like the idea of donuts. This is one I did the other day.

I'm not trying to be self-gratifying, but sometimes, you need to do that.

---

# Not all contributions are donuts <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: sometimes it's the little things that add up onto something big

---

# Stack Overflow <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: How many people go onto stackoverflow to ask

Does anyone know how many questions there have been answered on SO?


---

 <img src="pictures/so1.png" />

Note: SO recently 10 million questions.

Go on there and find your project's tag, and thank the people who are answering your things for you

You might have a standalone SO instance for your Q&A

---


 <img src="pictures/so2.png" />


Note: 

If a dev found a solution just half of those times, and it saved them just 30 minutes, that's nearly 1.85 billion hours saved.

It's enough to read all of Wikipedia. 12,000 times.

8 million developers come here every day.

It'd be a bigger country than more than half the world's nations.

There are about 51,000 developers on the site at any given second. This is what 51,000 people looks like.

Together, we've built a place where every 12 seconds a developer posts an answer that helps fellow coders.

Note: Your community advocates need your thanks

You can thank them by giving them something extremely useful

---

# But why say<br>thank you? <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: Apart from it being a nice thing todo.

---


# It's nice thing to do <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: Not getting acknowedgement suck

Burnout 

Plight of the organiser

# Encourage continued engagement <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: They have done a thing once, they will do it again.

Such as why I'm here

They needed someone because a speaker had to pull out

---

# Voluntold <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: I'm super encourageable. I think half the stuff i do is average until validated

Which which is why i'm here

---

# Nurture the seed <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: with a bit of influence, these people can grow into awesome

Cython for distributed-multiprocess steganographic md5sum-collision generation.

---

# Communication within your project <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: Mentioning things in your release notes is a good thing. MediaGolbin does this

But the scope of this communication is only within your existing community.

You need to extend to more general communications

# Give your helpers something to show for their work <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: Looking at any github project page we can see all the contributors right?

THere's a button right at the top and everything

---

Note: But if we click it, then we don't actually get the contributors

We get the top ones, with a graph, ranked by lines of code

What if, as a project owner, you could give props to community members

Note: But how can you find who in your project community to give props to?

The customisation of the github profile may not exist, but the data for who could be given props does

Plus, feature requests from Tim GW and Stewart Smith

Tim's code was merged this morning, so he's gone from a non-code to a code contrib! I hope he adds more things~
