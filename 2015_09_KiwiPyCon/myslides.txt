It's always the same, one or two after the talk

#= What counts?
##- Issues and Pull Requests
##- (in the past year)
##- Commits
##- <p>(against <code>master</code> or <code>gh-pages</code>)</p>


---

#= But only if...

##- you own the repo
##- you're a collaborator
##- you're in the owner organisation
##- you forked the repo
##- .. but commits don't count on forks

---

#= What counts?
##- Only some of your work. 

---

#= Sound too hard?
##- It's ok, there's a hack for that
