## How to handle abandoned projects, Take Two.

At PyCon AU 2015, Katie was due to present to talks: one on acknowledging
contributions that aren't code, and one on how to handle abandoned projects. 

The second talk was never presented. 

This keynote explores the content of that talk, examining how to handle an
unexpected blow to the leadership of an open source project. 

It is also a story about the events around that Sunday afternoon in Brisbane. 

This is a talk about mitigation against failure, software abandonment, speaker
anxiety, the amazing Python community, and ice-cream.  

Content warning: This talk contains strong themes.
