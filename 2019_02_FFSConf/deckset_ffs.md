# [fit] is *real software development*

^ CSS is hard, yo. Trying to make something look nice and responsive and practical and pretty is hard.

---
# [fit] **HTML, CSS, and JS**
# [fit] are *real languages*

---

# [fit] **SCRIPTING**
# [fit] is *real software development*

> But **PHP** is objectively bad! It's insecure af!
-- Hacker News, StackOverflow, etc

---

# [fit] **PHP** *was* the
# [fit] **ONLY** way to do things

^ Back in the back in the day, if you wanted to do any server side functionality. It was and still is accessible and popular. 

^ but it's critical to remember that

---

# [fit] The more **USERS**
# [fit] the more *MISUSERS*

^ The more users a product have, the more misuses are popular. 

^ Consider that you hear about all the "problems" with PHP because it's used by more people. You don't hear "problems" about less popular languages. 

^ and having a popular language means you'll have more experts but also more beginners. Begineers who don't know any better. 

---

# [fit] *Education* lifts
# [fit] **ALL OF US**

^ Educating these beginners to know about the pitfalls and how to work around them. how to build secure apps, is paramount to lifting up the community as a whole

# [fit] If you *program*
# [fit] **YOU ARE A PROGRAMMER**

---

# [fit] Don't be a *gatekeeping*
# [fit] **MOTHERFUCKER**


---

# [fit] "You're not a real programmer unless..."
# [fit] **IS BULLSHIT**

^ There's nothing more degrading than having a random dudebro tell you your work is invalid. It's demoralising. I've gotten a thick skin over the years, but it still cuts. Imagine those who have only heard this. We have lost so much talent due to this bullshit. 

---

# [fit] **CONTEMPT CULTURE**
# [fit] *actively harms* our industry

^ By saying that folks aren't real programmers, they aren't as likely to keep at it, thus they don't continue in the industry, and that's bad. 


---

# [fit] We are *humans*
# [fit] working with *humans*
# [fit] to develop software
# [fit] for the **BENEFIT OF** *humans*

^ There are many tools in our industry; languages, operating systems, environments; 

^ But at the end of the day, whatever we made is for the benefit of humans. We are making lives earlier, information more easily accessible, live more pleasent. 

^ this insidious infighting will be the death of us all. Stop that shit.
