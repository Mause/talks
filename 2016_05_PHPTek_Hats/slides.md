 <div style='width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/question.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: But how do we track all these contributions that we make

---

 <div style='width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/github.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: GitHub gives us some of this functionality

Pretty graphs and the like

Note: but it's not exactly perfect

And it only include itself

There are other ways - project specific, etc

 <div style='width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;'><p align='center'><img height='400px' src='pictures/question.svg'></p></div> <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: But what about everything else?

Code Review

Documentation 

Testing

User Groups / Presentations

Note: Let me tell you about Leslie

Amazing human being

# #LABHR <!-- .slide: class="center" -->
## bit.do/LABHR

Note: She started this hashtag, and wrote a blog post about it

Note: Which I've turned into a easy to read manual to try and spread the message

“No, this is great. This gives me one of those places to hang your hat.

You know, something you can list on your LinkedIn profile instead of just a project that you work on for free because you love it.

But no one really knows about it or notices.”



---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_0.svg" />

<span class="dasfoot">#LABHR</span>
Note: So Leslie + Blog = 5 steps

---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_1.svg" />

<span class="dasfoot">#LABHR</span>
Note: write the list

---

 <img src="pictures/Solution_2.svg" />

<span class="dasfoot">#LABHR</span>
Note: send the list

Note: Simple! Nice! Helpful!

---

 <img src="pictures/halp.svg" style="margin-top: -50px" />

Note: But it didn't get that much traction

Leslie reported ~30 known LinkedIn recommendation

I've done talks in multiple different cities/languages

It's always the same, one or two after the talk

(PyConAU exception - because I refused to get off stage until 10 tweets happened)
(This did result in some residiual activity during the sprints)
Maybe y'all need a LIVE DEMO

The fact that I didn't know half of these existed is a problem in itself.

Giving ourselves a little celebration if noone else will

Tweeting the donut

Piggybacking on a picture of a donut (instagram makes this OK).


---

 <img src="pictures/MyDonut.jpg" />

Note: I like the idea of donuts. This is one I did the other day.

I'm not trying to be self-gratifying, but sometimes, you need to do that.

---

# Not all contributions are donuts <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: sometimes it's the little things that add up onto something big

---

 <img src="pictures/MyStackOverflowProfile.png" />

Note: The profiles are now really nice!

# Just a drop<br>in the ocean <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: 
How many people go onto stackoverflow to ask

Does anyone know how many questions there have been answered on SO?


---

 <img src="pictures/so1.png" />

Note: SO recently 10 million questions.

Go on there and find your project's tag, and thank the people who are answering your things for you

You might have a standalone SO instance for your Q&A

---


 <img src="pictures/so2.png" />


Note: 

If a dev found a solution just half of those times, and it saved them just 30 minutes, that's nearly 1.85 billion hours saved.

It's enough to read all of Wikipedia. 12,000 times.

8 million developers come here every day.

It'd be a bigger country than more than half the world's nations.

There are about 51,000 developers on the site at any given second. This is what 51,000 people looks like.

Together, we've built a place where every 12 seconds a developer posts an answer that helps fellow coders.

You can thank them by giving them something extremely useful

# "Foot in the Door" <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: "Fear, Uncertainty<br>and Dopamine" - Paul Fenwick

Amazing talk about a few different issues about hacking brains

Brilliant riff about making contrubutors stick

Foot in the Door - Drive Safely sign - 17% baseline, 76% with pre-sticker

Car Bumper Stickers

A tiny little foot in the door

STICKERS 

Little things = seed, -> improvement over time

"If you see someone doing something like that - acknowledge them like crazy

# Change self image <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: 
it makes them feel valued

self image change, they feel included in the project, and it makes them feel good

but it also binds their fate to yours

if your project fails, it reflects badly on them, because they are now involed in your project


---

 <img src="pictures/question.svg" />

Note: But just how can we say thank you

---

# Communication<br>within<br>your project <!-- .slide: class="center" -->

Note: Mentioning things in your release notes is a good thing. MediaGolbin does this

Drupal concatenates thread commentors into git commit message

But the scope of this communication is only within your existing community.

You need to extend to more general communications

# Communication<br>outside<br>your project <!-- .slide: class="center" -->
